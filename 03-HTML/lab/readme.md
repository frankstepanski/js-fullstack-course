# Bootstrap Makeover Lab

:tada: Tonight’s Live Bootstrap Lab Activity!

👉 **Every Friday live session will include a small hands-on lab exercise!**

Last time we built solid HTML and then gave it a style glow-up using CSS.  
Tonight we take the SAME project even further by adding **Bootstrap**, either by linking the CDN or installing it in a Node project. 

We'll continue building on your **Restaurant Menu** or **Personal Trading Card** that you already built.

I’ll again ask a few random folks to share what they’ve styled — just like before!

## 🎨 What We’re Doing

- add Bootstrap (CDN or npm)
- enhance layout, spacing, and structure
- add real UI components that match your page
- practice responsive design
- layer Bootstrap on top of your CSS (not replace it)

👉 Think **CSS glow-up ➜ Bootstrap power-up!**

### 1️⃣ Add Bootstrap

You have TWO options:

**Option A — Add Bootstrap via CDN**  
Add the Bootstrap CSS CDN link in your HTML head section, above your own CSS file.

**Option B — Install Bootstrap with npm**  
If your project uses Node:
- install Bootstrap with npm  
- import Bootstrap’s CSS from your main JS or CSS entry point

Either approach is fine — choose the one that matches how you’re working.

### 2️⃣ Add a Bootstrap Container

Wrap your main page content in a Bootstrap container so your Restaurant Menu or Trading Card layout has consistent width and padding instead of stretching edge-to-edge.

### 3️⃣ Choose Bootstrap Components That Fit Your Project

Pick **at least two or three** components that make sense for the project you already built.

### If you built the Restaurant Menu:

Good component ideas:
- **Cards**  Use cards for sections like “Pizzas”, “Drinks”, or “Desserts”.
- **Buttons** Example: “Order Now”, “Call Us”, “View Full Menu”.
- **Badges**  Mark items as “New”, “Spicy”, “Vegetarian”, “Gluten-Free”.
- **Alerts**  Highlight “Today’s Special”, “Limited Time Offer”, or “Closed on Holidays”.
- **Navbar**  Simple navigation bar at the top with links like “Menu”, “About”, “Contact”.
- **List Group** Show menu items in a clean, stacked list with prices.
- **Accordion** (optional) Collapse sections like “Starters”, “Mains”, and “Desserts” into expandable panels.

### If you built a Personal Trading Card:

Good component ideas:
- **Cards**  Make the main trading card layout a Bootstrap card.
- **Badges** Show rarity, power level, or role (for example: “Legendary”, “Support”, “Tank”).
- **Buttons** Example: “Learn More”, “View Wiki”, “Follow Character”.
- **Alerts**  Highlight fun facts, special abilities, or warnings.
- **Grid / Columns** Place the character image on one side and stats on the other.
- **List Group**  Display stats like strength, speed, intelligence as a vertical list.
- **Progress Bars** (optional) Represent stats such as health, stamina, or experience.

Choose components that support your content — not just random widgets.

### 4️⃣ Upgrade Typography & Spacing with Utilities

Use Bootstrap utilities to fine-tune:
- font weight for headings
- centered or left-aligned text where appropriate
- muted text for descriptions
- extra space around sections using margin and padding classes
- larger display-style headings for the main title or restaurant name

### 5️⃣  Add One Meaningful Button

Add at least one button that feels natural for your project:

- Restaurant Menu examples:  
  “Order Now”, “Call for Pickup”, “Reserve a Table”, “View Location”.

- Trading Card examples:  
  “View Wiki”, “More Details”, “Next Card”, “See Abilities”.

Make sure the button stands out visually and has a clear purpose.

## ✨ Optional Extra Flair

- Combine your existing CSS with Bootstrap utilities in a way that feels intentional.
- Use card shadows for depth on your main content.
- Experiment with different background colors or sections.
- Use Bootstrap text color utilities to highlight important elements.

## ✅ Lab Requirements

To consider this lab complete, your page should have:

- Bootstrap included (CDN or npm)
- a Bootstrap container around your main content
- at least two or three Bootstrap components that fit your project
- improved spacing and typography using utilities
- a simple responsive layout (columns or grid)
- at least one Bootstrap button with a clear purpose

Same deal as before — build individually during class, and I’ll invite a few folks to share their Bootstrap upgrades!
