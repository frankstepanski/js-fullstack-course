# 👋 Welcome to Full-Stack Software Engineering

Ever wonder how apps like Spotify, TikTok, or ChatGPT actually work? Behind every animation, button click, and login screen is code, the language developers use to turn ideas into real, working software.

In this program, you’ll learn how small pieces of code come together to form full applications, and how real engineering teams plan, build, and ship the products we use every day. The curriculum is delivered through live, interactive sessions, so you are learning directly with an instructor, asking questions, and receiving feedback along the way. You will work with the same tools and technologies used by real-world teams and develop skills that extend well beyond tutorials.

If you are reviewing this curriculum independently and are not currently enrolled in the program, you are still welcome to reach out. One-on-one sessions are available for guided walkthroughs, deeper explanations, personalized technical support, and career coaching guidance, including advice on learning paths, portfolios, interviews, and next steps toward your goals.

## 📘 Prerequisites

This course assumes:
- No prior coding experience  
- Basic computer literacy  
- Willingness to practice and experiment  

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn — A Complete Journey Through the JavaScript Stack

### **Frontend Development**
Build the parts of a website users see and interact with.

- **HTML & CSS** — structure and style modern, accessible, responsive pages  
- **JavaScript** — from fundamentals to advanced concepts (DOM, APIs, events, logic)  
- **React.js** — build dynamic, component-based interfaces using hooks, props, and state  

### ⚙️ Intermediate & Advanced JavaScript

Go beyond “just making it work” and understand how JavaScript runs under the hood — both in the browser and in Node.js.

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: classes, inheritance, reusable architecture  
- **Asynchronous Programming**  
  - Callbacks  
  - Promises  
  - `async` / `await`  
  - How the **event loop** enables non-blocking execution  
- **JavaScript Internals**  
  - Call stack and memory model  
  - Execution context and scope chain  
  - Closures and persistent data  
- **Developer Essentials**  
  - ES Modules vs CommonJS  
  - Error handling  
  - Browser APIs & Fetch  
  - Debugging strategies with breakpoints and stack traces  


### 🔷 TypeScript Fundamentals

Learn how professional teams add **safety, clarity, and confidence** to JavaScript codebases.

- Why TypeScript exists and what problems it solves  
- Primitive types, objects, arrays, and functions  
- Type inference vs explicit typing  
- Interfaces and type aliases  
- Optional properties and union types  
- Using TypeScript with React components  
- Understanding compile-time errors vs runtime behavior  

> Emphasis is placed on **using TypeScript as a development tool**, not a replacement for JavaScript.

### 🧪 Testing Fundamentals

Learn how engineers verify that code works — and keeps working as applications grow.

- Why testing exists and what problems it solves  
- Types of testing  
  - Unit tests  
  - Integration tests  
  - Component tests  
  - End-to-end (E2E) tests  
- Writing basic tests for JavaScript and React components  
- Understanding test assertions and expectations  
- How testing improves refactoring confidence and code quality  

> Testing is taught as a **confidence and safety tool**, not a requirement for perfection.


### 🖥️ Backend Development

Learn how to build the systems that power applications behind the scenes.

- **Node.js** — execute JavaScript outside the browser  
- **Express.js** — build fast, maintainable APIs  
- **Databases**  
  - **SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** — relational schemas, joins, constraints  
  - **MongoDB** — flexible document storage  
- **Core Backend Concepts**  
  - RESTful API design  
  - Authentication & authorization  
  - Environment variables & secure configuration  

### 🤖 Using AI Tools as a Problem-Solving Partner

Modern software engineers increasingly use AI tools to work faster and smarter. You’ll practice how to:

- Use tools like **GitHub Copilot**, **ChatGPT**, **Cursor**, and **Codeium** to get unstuck and explore code solutions  
- Prompt AI clearly with context and constraints (e.g. "Write a function in JavaScript that...")  
- Review and refine AI-generated code, rather than copy-pasting blindly  
- Use AI as a research assistant — summarizing docs, explaining errors, or generating boilerplate code  
- Avoid over-reliance: always understand what code does before using it  

AI tools are powerful collaborators — but **your logic, judgment, and debugging skills still matter most**. You'll learn how to balance speed with understanding as you grow from beginner to builder.

### 👥 Work Like a Real Development Team: Agile & Scrum

This course doesn’t just teach you code — it teaches you **how professional engineering teams operate**.

You’ll learn the foundations of Agile and the **Scrum** framework:

- Sprint cycles  
- Daily standups  
- Sprint planning & retrospectives  
- Team roles: Developer, Product Owner, Scrum Master  

### 💼 Career Readiness: Job Search Prep

Mastering code is only one part of becoming a professional engineer. You'll also build the confidence and skills to get hired.

#### ✍️ Resume & LinkedIn Best Practices

- Learn how to write strong bullet points using the **impact → action → context** framework
- Highlight projects with live links, GitHub repos, and tech stack
- Tailor your profile to reflect real-world development experience

#### 🗣️ Interview Preparation

- Technical interview strategies (whiteboarding, pair coding, debugging)
- Common question types: data structures, system design, behavioral
- **STAR** method for communicating clearly in interviews

## 🌱 From Beginner to Builder

By the end of this course, you will:

- Build full-stack applications from scratch  
- Design and deploy secure REST APIs  
- Structure clean, maintainable JavaScript code  
- Debug confidently with modern tools  
- Implement unit, integration, component, and end-to-end (E2E) tests
- Present your work like a professional engineer  
- **Think like an engineer — solve problems you haven’t seen before**
