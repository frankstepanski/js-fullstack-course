# 👋 Welcome to Full-Stack Software Engineering

Have you ever wondered how apps like Spotify, TikTok, or ChatGPT are built? Behind every animation, button click, and login flow is **code** — the language developers use to communicate with computers and bring ideas to life.

In this course, you’ll learn how small lines of code grow into full applications — and how real engineering teams design, build, and ship the software you use every day. You’ll work with the same tools and technologies used at top companies and develop the skills to build systems that scale.

## 📘 Prerequisites

This course assumes:
- No prior coding experience  
- Basic computer literacy  
- Willingness to practice and experiment  

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn — A Complete Journey Through the JavaScript Stack

### **Frontend Development**
Build the parts of a website users see and interact with.

- **HTML & CSS** — structure and style modern, accessible, responsive pages  
- **JavaScript** — from fundamentals to advanced concepts (DOM, APIs, events, logic)  
- **React.js** — build dynamic, component-based interfaces using hooks, props, and state  

### ⚙️ Intermediate & Advanced JavaScript

Go beyond “just making it work” and understand how JavaScript runs under the hood — both in the browser and in Node.js.

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: classes, inheritance, reusable architecture  
- **Asynchronous Programming**  
  - Callbacks  
  - Promises  
  - `async` / `await`  
  - How the **event loop** enables non-blocking execution  
- **JavaScript Internals**  
  - Call stack and memory model  
  - Execution context and scope chain  
  - Closures and persistent data  
- **Developer Essentials**  
  - ES Modules vs CommonJS  
  - Error handling  
  - Browser APIs & Fetch  
  - Debugging strategies with breakpoints and stack traces  

### 🖥️ Backend Development

Learn how to build the systems that power applications behind the scenes.

- **Node.js** — execute JavaScript outside the browser  
- **Express.js** — build fast, maintainable APIs  
- **Databases**  
  - **SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** — relational schemas, joins, constraints  
  - **MongoDB** — flexible document storage  
- **Core Backend Concepts**  
  - RESTful API design  
  - Authentication & authorization  
  - Environment variables & secure configuration  

## 🧠 Computer Science & Engineering Foundations

Develop the engineering mindset needed for real-world software development.

- **Data Structures & Algorithms** — arrays, lists, trees, hashing, sorting  
- **Software Engineering Principles**  
  - Git & GitHub version control  
  - Clean code, modular architecture, DRY/SOLID patterns  
  - Unit testing and debugging techniques  
  - CI/CD and deployment fundamentals  

## 👥 Work Like a Real Development Team: Agile & Scrum

This course doesn’t just teach you code — it teaches you **how professional engineering teams operate**.

You’ll learn the foundations of Agile and the **Scrum** framework:

- Sprint cycles  
- Daily standups  
- Sprint planning & retrospectives  
- Team roles: Developer, Product Owner, Scrum Master  

## 💼 Career Readiness: Job Search Prep

Mastering code is only one part of becoming a professional engineer. You'll also build the confidence and skills to get hired.

### ✍️ Resume & LinkedIn Best Practices

- Learn how to write strong bullet points using the **impact → action → context** framework
- Highlight projects with live links, GitHub repos, and tech stack
- Tailor your profile to reflect real-world development experience

### 🗣️ Interview Preparation

- Technical interview strategies (whiteboarding, pair coding, debugging)
- Common question types: data structures, system design, behavioral
- **STAR** method for communicating clearly in interviews

### 🎭 Mock Interview Practice

- Mock interviews with peers, mentors, and staff
- Practice both behavioral and technical interviews
- Get personalized feedback and build interview stamina

## 🌱 From Beginner to Builder

By the end of this course, you will:

- Build full-stack applications from scratch  
- Design and deploy secure REST APIs  
- Structure clean, maintainable JavaScript code  
- Debug confidently with modern tools  
- Use Git, GitHub, and Agile workflows collaboratively  
- Present your work like a professional engineer  

Whether you’re preparing for a new career or leveling up your skills, this course gives you the tools, experience, and confidence to build real-world projects.
