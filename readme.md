# 👋 Welcome to Full-Stack Software Engineering

Have you ever wondered how apps like Spotify, TikTok, or ChatGPT are built? Behind every button, every animation, and every “click to login” is something called **code** — the language we use to talk to computers.

In this course, we’ll explore how small lines of code turn into large, powerful systems — and how real-world software engineers collaborate to make it happen. You'll dive into the same technologies used at top tech companies to build apps that scale.

## What You'll Learn — A Full Tour of the JavaScript Stack

### **Frontend Development**
- **HTML & CSS**: Structure and style modern web pages — responsive, accessible, and mobile-friendly.
- **JavaScript (Beginner to Advanced)**: Learn how programming works from variables and functions to working with APIs and events.
- **React.js**: Build dynamic, interactive UIs using components, props, hooks, and state.

### **Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript**

Go beyond basic syntax and learn how JavaScript truly works under the hood — both in the browser and on Node.js.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Understand how to design reusable, maintainable code using classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Master non-blocking code using:
  - Callbacks
  - Promises
  - `async` / `await`
  - Understanding how the **event loop** handles asynchronous tasks
- **JavaScript Engine & Execution**
  - How the **call stack** works in Node and the browser
  - **Execution context** and the **scope chain**
  - What **closures** are and how they preserve data
  - How functions are stored and invoked in memory
- **Developer Essentials**:
  - Modular code organization with ES Modules and CommonJS
  - Error handling strategies in production code
  - Using browser APIs & Fetch for data fetching
  - Debugging using breakpoints, stack traces, and logging tools

---

### **Backend Development**
- **Node.js**: Use JavaScript outside the browser — power your server logic, and integrate APIs.
- **Express.js**: Build scalable APIs with routes, controllers, middleware, and proper error handling.
- **Databases**:
  - **SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** — use relational databases with structured schemas, joins, and transactions.
  - **MongoDB** — interact with unstructured data using a flexible document model.
- **Backend Concepts**:
  - RESTful API design
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Environment variables and configuration

## Computer Science + Engineering Foundations
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Lists, trees, sorting, hashing — critical thinking for coding interviews and performance.
- **Software Engineering Principles**:
  - Version control with Git/GitHub
  - Clean code, modular design, DRY & SOLID patterns
  - Unit testing and debugging
  - Deployment and CI/CD basics

## Collaborate Like a Real Team: Agile & Scrum

This course doesn’t just teach you code — it teaches you how to **work like a professional developer**.

### Agile Methodology
- Deliver value in *iterations*
- Adapt based on feedback

### Scrum Framework

You’ll be introduced to **Scrum**, one of the most popular frameworks used in Agile software development teams. You'll learn:

- What **sprints** are (short, focused work cycles)
- The purpose of **daily standups**, **sprint planning**, and **retrospectives**
- The different team roles like **Developer**, **Product Owner**, and **Scrum Master**

By understanding Scrum, you'll gain insight into how professional teams organize their work, collaborate effectively, and deliver software in a structured, predictable way — knowledge that will help you thrive in modern development environments.

You’ll:
- Break down large features into tasks
- Use JIRA or Trello to manage work
- Review, demo, and deploy your work — just like real teams

## Your Path from Beginner to Builder

By the end of the course, you'll be able to:

- Build full-stack apps from scratch (frontend + backend + database)
- Design and deploy REST APIs
- Write clean and reusable code using modern JavaScript patterns
- Debug issues confidently, and collaborate using Git & GitHub
- Work in teams using Agile/Scrum — and present your work professionally

Whether you're preparing to become a software engineer or leveling up your technical skills — this course gives you the hands-on skills, tools, and problem-solving mindset needed to build real-world projects and grow into a confident developer.
