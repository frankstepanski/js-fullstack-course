# Getting Started in Web Development

As you begin your fullstack development journey with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's essential to understand the broader context of how the web works, what web developers do, and the tools and environments you’ll use. This foundation not only makes your learning easier but helps you see the bigger picture from day one.

## Know What You’re Building

Web development is divided into two main categories:

### Frontend
This is everything users see and interact with in the browser. It involves:
- HTML: the structure of the page  
- CSS: how it looks  
- JavaScript: how it behaves and responds  

Understanding how these work together gives you control over creating responsive layouts, dynamic content updates, and accessible interfaces.

### Backend
Even though you'll start with the frontend, it's important to know that the backend manages data, processes requests, and handles logic. It will become crucial when building APIs or connecting user actions (like signup) to a database.

Understanding this early:
- Helps you connect user actions to behind-the-scenes processes  
- Gives context to frontend behavior (like form submission and data validation)  
- Builds foundational knowledge for later fullstack skills (like Express and SQL)

## Think Like a Developer

Writing code is only one part of being a developer. You must learn:
- How to navigate your computer with files, folders, and the terminal  
- How to troubleshoot and debug errors  
- How to search documentation effectively  
- How to build incrementally and test continuously  

This mindset prepares you to solve real-world problems, not just complete exercises.

## Use the Right Tools

Before starting, you should be comfortable with the essential tools used in modern development:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Visual Studio Code | Code editor with extensions for debugging and formatting |
| Node.js and npm | Enables JavaScript to run outside the browser and manage packages |
| Git and GitHub | Tracks changes and allows collaboration with others |
| Google Chrome | Includes built-in tools for inspecting and testing web pages |

Early exposure to these tools:
- Helps you build real projects efficiently  
- Simplifies testing and debugging  
- Supports best practices like version control and reusable code  

## Understand the Environment

Understanding how the web works behind the scenes allows you to work confidently across the stack:

- IP addresses help computers find the right server  
- DNS translates readable names (like google.com) to IP addresses  
- HTTP/HTTPS are protocols for sending and receiving data over the web  
- localhost (`127.0.0.1`) lets you run and test apps on your own machine  
- Servers respond to requests and deliver content or data to browsers  

Knowing this helps:
- Explain what happens when you open a page or submit a form  
- Prepare you to build and deploy applications in the future  
- Avoid common misconceptions about how websites work
