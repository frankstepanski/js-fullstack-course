# Your First Look at Web Development

Whether you're planning to create your first website or help build the next great online experience, this guide introduces you to the fundamental ideas and building blocks that make the modern web work.

##  What Does a Web Developer Do?

A **web developer** builds and maintains websites and web applications — the sites and tools you use every day like YouTube, Amazon, or Gmail.

Web developers take ideas and turn them into working, interactive pages that people can use in a browser.

They often:
- Create the **layout and design** users see (the *frontend*).
- Write the **logic and data systems** behind the scenes (the *backend*).
- Test, debug, and maintain their code.
- Collaborate with designers, other developers, and clients to make sure the website works smoothly.

In short:  
> A web developer is like an architect + builder for the online world.

## Frontend vs Backend Development

Web development is usually divided into two main parts:

### **Frontend (Client Side)**
This is everything users *see and interact with* in the browser.

**Key traits:**
- Focuses on the user experience and design.
- Runs on the user’s device (in their browser).
- Handles things like buttons, menus, forms, colors, and layouts.

**Example:** When you click “Add to Cart” on a shopping site, the **frontend** shows your cart update instantly.

### **Backend (Server Side)**
This is everything that happens *behind the scenes*.

**Key traits:**
- Focuses on data, servers, and application logic.
- Runs on a web server, not in the browser.
- Handles things like databases, authentication, and APIs.

**Example:** When you log in or save data, the **backend** checks your password and stores your info safely in a database.

**In short:**
| Part | Runs On | Focus | Example |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Frontend** | Your browser | What the user sees | Buttons, forms, colors |
| **Backend** | The server | What the app does | Login, saving data |

## Core Frontend Technologies

Frontend developers use a combination of languages and libraries to create websites that are both beautiful and functional.

| Technology | What It Does | Example Use |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **HTML** | The *structure* of a web page. Think of it like the skeleton. | Text, headings, images |
| **CSS** | The *style* of a web page. Think of it like clothing or design. | Colors, layouts, animations |
| **JavaScript** | The *behavior* of a web page. Think of it like movement or logic. | Buttons, interactivity, forms |
| **React** | A popular JavaScript *library* for building complex user interfaces quickly. | Apps like Facebook, Netflix |
| **Redux** | A *state management tool* used with React to track app data. | Keeping your cart updated |
| **jQuery** | An older JavaScript library that simplifies animations and effects. | Toggling menus, fading images |
| **TypeScript** | A version of JavaScript that adds structure and helps prevent errors. | Used in large-scale projects |

Frontend developers mix these tools to make modern, responsive, and interactive websites.

## Core Backend Technologies

Backend developers create and manage the “engine” of the website — the part users don’t see but that makes everything work.

| Technology | What It Does | Example Use |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Node.js** | Lets developers run JavaScript on the server. | Powering backend logic |
| **Express.js** | A lightweight Node framework that helps handle routes and requests. | Building APIs quickly |
| **SQL** | A language for managing and querying databases. | Searching or filtering data |
| **MySQL / PostgreSQL** | Two popular databases that store user info, tasks, or products. | Storing login info, orders, etc. |

Together, these tools let developers handle requests like “save my data,” “log me in,” or “fetch this list of products.”

## Essential Software Tools

When you start coding, you’ll use a few key pieces of software that help you write, run, and manage your projects.

| Tool | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** | A text editor made for coding. | Where you write and organize your code files. |
| **Node.js** | A JavaScript runtime that lets you run code outside the browser. | Lets you build backend apps or use tools like React. |
| **npm (Node Package Manager)** | Comes with Node.js. It installs libraries and tools easily. | Helps you add extra features or frameworks. |
| **Git** | A version control system that tracks changes to your code. | Lets you undo mistakes and collaborate safely. |
| **GitHub** | A website for storing and sharing your Git projects online. | Makes teamwork and sharing easy. |

These tools are the foundation of every developer’s workflow.

## Your Computer & the Internet

Before diving in, it helps to understand a few basic ideas:

- **Files and folders:** You’ll be creating and organizing lots of them.  
- **Command line (Terminal):** A simple text way to give instructions to your computer.  
- **Browsers:** Tools like Chrome display your web pages and help you debug them.  
- **Servers:** Computers that store and “serve” your website to other people online.  
- **The internet:** A giant network that connects your code (on a server) to users (in browsers).  

You don’t have to master this right away — just get comfortable exploring.

## Things to Install as a First-Time Developer

Here’s what you’ll need to set up your environment before starting your web development journey:

1. **A Browser (Google Chrome recommended)**  
   - Chrome is the most popular browser among developers.  
   - It includes developer tools for inspecting pages and debugging code.

2. **Node.js and npm**  
   - Download from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)  
   - Lets you run JavaScript outside the browser and use npm to install frameworks like React.

3. **Git**  
   - Download from [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)  
   - Helps you track changes to your code and collaborate using GitHub.

4. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
   - Download from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)  
   - A lightweight, free code editor that works with almost every programming language.

## In Summary

| Topic | Summary |
|-------|----------|
| **Web Developers** | Build and maintain websites and apps. |
| **Frontend** | Focuses on design and user experience (HTML, CSS, JS, React). |
| **Backend** | Focuses on data, servers, and logic (Node, Express, SQL). |
