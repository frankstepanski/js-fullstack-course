#  Understanding Agile and Scrum

Software isn’t built all at once — it’s built in *stages* that involve planning, building, testing, and improving.  
Over time, developers realized the old ways of doing this were **too slow and rigid**.  
That’s where **Agile** and **Scrum** came in — two modern approaches that make software development **faster, more flexible, and more human**.

##  What Is Agile?

###  Definition
**Agile** is a **mindset** — a way of thinking about and managing projects so teams can **adapt quickly** to change and deliver **working software frequently**.

Instead of spending months planning everything in advance, Agile teams:
- Work in **short, repeatable cycles**
- Get **continuous feedback** from users
- Improve and adjust the product **as they go**

###  Why Agile Was Created
Before Agile, most companies used something called the **Waterfall model** — a very step-by-step approach where:
1. You plan everything,
2. Then design,
3. Then code,
4. Then test,
5. Then launch.

The problem?  
If something changed mid-project (like new requirements or user feedback), it was **very hard and expensive** to go back and fix.  
Projects often took **too long** and didn’t match what users really needed.

Agile was created to **solve those problems** — it allows teams to be more **flexible**, **collaborative**, and **customer-focused**.

###  The 4 Core Values of the Agile Manifesto
In 2001, 17 software developers met and wrote the **Agile Manifesto**, which highlights 4 key values:

| Value | What It Means |
|-------|----------------|
| **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools** | People and communication matter more than strict rules |
| **Working software over comprehensive documentation** | Focus on building something that actually works |
| **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation** | Involve users and clients throughout development |
| **Responding to change over following a plan** | Be ready to adjust quickly instead of sticking to a fixed plan |

### 12 Basic Principles (Simplified)
1. Deliver working software **frequently**  
2. Welcome **changes**, even late in development  
3. Work closely with **customers and stakeholders**  
4. Build projects around **motivated individuals**  
5. Communicate **face-to-face** as much as possible  
6. Working software is the **main measure of progress**  
7. Keep a **sustainable pace** (avoid burnout)  
8. Focus on **technical excellence** and **good design**  
9. Keep things **simple**  
10. Teams **self-organize** rather than follow strict orders  
11. Regularly **reflect and improve** the process  
12. Strive for **continuous improvement**

##  What Is Scrum?

###  Definition
**Scrum** is one of the **most popular frameworks** for practicing Agile.  
Think of Agile as the **philosophy**, and Scrum as a **recipe** that shows *how* to do it.

Scrum organizes work into **small, repeatable time blocks** called **sprints** (usually 1–2 weeks).  
Each sprint delivers a **small piece of the product** that can be reviewed and tested by real users.

###  Key Roles in Scrum
| Role | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Product Owner** | Represents the customer; decides what features are most important |
| **Scrum Master** | Helps the team follow Scrum principles; removes obstacles |
| **Development Team** | The people who design, build, and test the product |

### Key Scrum Events
| Event | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| **Sprint Planning** | The team decides what to build in the next sprint |
| **Daily Scrum (Stand-up)** | 15-minute daily check-in: What did you do? What’s next? Any blockers? |
| **Sprint Review** | The team shows what they built and gets feedback |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | The team reflects on what went well and what can improve |

### Scrum Artifacts (Main Documents)
| Artifact | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Product Backlog** | A list of all desired features and improvements |
| **Sprint Backlog** | The smaller list of tasks the team will complete this sprint |
| **Increment** | The working product that results at the end of each sprint |

##  How Agile and Scrum Connect to the SDLC

Agile and Scrum don’t replace the SDLC —  
they **work within it** to make each phase more **flexible and collaborative**.

| SDLC Phase | How Agile/Scrum Fit In |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Planning** | The Product Owner prioritizes features in the product backlog. Planning happens before *each* sprint, not just once. |
| **Analysis & Design** | Teams analyze what’s needed for the next sprint and design only that part of the system. |
| **Development** | The team codes and builds small features in short sprints, not the entire app at once. |
| **Testing** | Testing happens **during** each sprint — bugs are found and fixed early. |
| **Deployment** | Each sprint can produce a working, shippable version of the software. |
| **Maintenance** | Continuous feedback from users leads to new sprint cycles for updates and fixes. |

So instead of doing each SDLC phase once in a long, linear project...  
➡️ Agile and Scrum let you **loop through the SDLC repeatedly** — planning, building, testing, and improving in short cycles.
