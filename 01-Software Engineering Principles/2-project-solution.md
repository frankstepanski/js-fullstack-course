#  Mini Project Solution: Study Tracker

## 1️⃣ Planning

This is where you come up with the idea and purpose of your project.  
You ask yourself big-picture questions:

- What problem am I trying to solve?  
- Who is it for?  
- What would success look like?

**Example:**  
Students often forget deadlines and feel overwhelmed with schoolwork.  
The **Study Tracker** app helps them keep track of tasks, mark what’s done, and stay on top of due dates.  
Success means students feel more organized and complete more assignments on time.

## 2️⃣ Requirements

Now you decide **what** your app should do — the main features or functions.  
Think of this step like writing a “to-do list” for your app itself.

**Example Requirements:**
- Add a new task (for example: “Finish math homework”)  
- Mark a task as complete  
- Delete a task you no longer need  
- Save the list so it’s still there when you open the page again  

You don’t need to worry about *how* these things are built yet — just what you want the app to do.

## 3️⃣ Design

This step is all about **what the app looks like** and **how the user interacts with it**.  
You can draw this on paper or describe it simply.

**Example Design (in words):**
- At the top, there’s a box to type a new task.  
- Below that, there’s a list showing all tasks.  
- Each task has a checkbox to mark it “done.”  
- There’s also a “remove” button to delete a task.

The goal of this step is to **visualize** how someone would actually use your app.

## 4️⃣ Development

Now it’s time to **build** the app.  
This is where your design turns into something real and working.  
Even if you’re not coding yet, think of it like assembling all the pieces from your plan.

**Example (in plain English):**
- When someone types a task and clicks “Add,” it appears in the list.  
- When they check the box, it shows as “done.”  
- When they click “Remove,” it disappears.  
- The app remembers the list the next time they open it.

This is the stage where developers write code — but what matters most here is understanding that every feature is just a set of small, logical steps.

## 5️⃣ Testing

Once the app works, you test it to make sure everything does what it’s supposed to.  
Testing means trying different things — even trying to break it — to find problems early.

**Example Tests:**
- What happens if you try to add a task with no title?  
- Does it remember your list after you close and reopen the page?  
- Does the “done” box really save when you check it?  

Testing helps make sure your app feels smooth and reliable to use.

## 6️⃣ Deployment & Maintenance

When your app is ready, you **share it** so others can use it.  
That might mean just saving your file and sending it to a friend, or uploading it online for free (like on GitHub Pages or Netlify).

Maintenance means checking on your app over time and improving it.

**Example Future Updates:**
- Add reminders or notifications  
- Organize tasks by course or priority  
- Show weekly progress or study streaks  

Even a simple app can grow and improve as you learn more.

## Summary

| **SDLC Phase** | **What Happens** | **Study Tracker Example** |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Planning | Define your goal and purpose | Help students stay organized |
| Requirements | List what features you’ll include | Add, mark done, delete, save |
| Design | Sketch or describe how it looks | Task box, checklist, remove button |
| Development | Build it (turn plan into product) | Tasks appear, can be checked or removed |
| Testing | Try it and fix problems | Check saving, marking done, and deleting |
| Deployment & Maintenance | Share it and keep improving it | Host online, add reminders later |


##  Key Takeaways

- You don’t need to know how to code to start thinking like a software developer.  
- SDLC gives you a roadmap — it’s about **how to think**, not just how to program.  
- Every app, big or small, starts with the same basic steps:  
  **plan it → design it → build it → test it → share it → improve it.**
