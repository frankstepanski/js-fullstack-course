# Why CRUD Matters

The SQL commands you just learned --- **INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and
DELETE** --- are the **foundation of nearly every backend system**.

These four operations are known as **CRUD**:

| Operation | SQL Command | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Create    | INSERT      | Adds new data |
| Read      | SELECT      | Retrieves data |
| Update    | UPDATE      | Changes existing data |
| Delete    | DELETE      | Removes data |

Almost every action a user performs in an application eventually becomes
one of these database operations.

For example:

| User Action              | What Happens in the Database              |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Creating an account      | `INSERT` adds a new row                   |
| Viewing a profile        | `SELECT` retrieves the user's data        |
| Editing account settings | `UPDATE` modifies the row                 |
| Deleting an account      | `DELETE` removes the row                  |

Even though the user interacts with a **frontend interface**, the
backend is constantly running these SQL commands to manage the
application's data.

Example flow:


    USER ACTION
        │
        ▼
    ┌──────────────────────┐
    │   Frontend (React)   │
    │  User clicks button  │
    │  Submits a form      │
    └───────────┬──────────┘
                │
                ▼
    ┌──────────────────────────┐
    │   API Request (HTTP)     │
    │   GET /users             │
    │   POST /users            │
    │   PUT /users/1           │
    │   DELETE /users/1        │
    └───────────┬──────────────┘
                │
                ▼
    ┌──────────────────────────┐
    │ Backend (Node / Express) │
    │  Processes the request   │
    │  Validates data          │
    └───────────┬──────────────┘
                │
                ▼
    ┌──────────────────────────┐
    │        SQL Query         │
    │ SELECT / INSERT          │
    │ UPDATE / DELETE          │
    └───────────┬──────────────┘
                │
                ▼
    ┌──────────────────────────┐
    │        DATABASE          │
    │   Table data updated     │
    └──────────────────────────┘


This is how modern applications **store, retrieve, and manage
information**.

## The Backbone of Real Applications

In real systems, data is organized across **many tables that connect to
each other**.

For example, an application might have tables like:

users\
orders\
products\
comments\
posts\
courses\
transactions

Each table stores **a different type of information**, but the tables
are **connected through relationships**.

Designing these tables and relationships is the backbone of backend development. 

>CRUD operations only work effectively when the database structure is well designed.

### Real-World Examples

### E-Commerce

An online store might organize its data like this:

    users
      │
      ▼
    orders
      │
      ▼
    order_items
      │
      ▼
    products


A user places an order.

Behind the scenes:

-   `INSERT` adds a row to `orders`
-   `INSERT` adds rows to `order_items`
-   `SELECT` retrieves product data
-   `UPDATE` might adjust inventory

## Thinking Like a Data Architect

Learning SQL isn't just about memorizing commands.

It's about understanding:

-   how data is structured
-   how information connects
-   how systems evolve as applications grow

Developers who design databases think like **data architects**.

They plan:

-   what tables should exist
-   how tables relate to each other
-   how to avoid duplicate data
-   how to keep data consistent as the system grows

This is what allows applications to scale from **small projects to systems used by millions of people**.

## Keys: The Foundation of All Relationships

Before tables can connect, they need **keys** — the backbone of relational databases.  
Earlier, you created tables using a `PRIMARY KEY` like this:

```sql
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
```

At that time, you only needed to know:

> “A primary key uniquely identifies each row.”

Now we’ll explore why keys matter, how they work, and how they enable powerful multi-table queries.

## 🗝️ What Is a Primary Key?

A **Primary Key (PK)** uniquely identifies each record in a table.

✔️ Must be **unique**  
✔️ Must **not be NULL**  
✔️ Every table should have one  

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

Visualization:

| id | name |
|----|------|
| 1  | Alice |
| 2  | Bob   |

Primary keys act like:

- A student ID number  
- A product SKU  
- An order number  

Without them, SQL can’t reliably find or update the right row.

## What Is a Foreign Key?

A **Foreign Key (FK)** is how tables connect to each other.  
It references the **primary key** of another table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INT REFERENCES students(id),
  course_id INT REFERENCES courses(id)
);
```

This ensures:

- You can’t enroll a student who doesn’t exist.  
- You can’t reference a deleted course.  
- Your data stays meaningful across tables.

Foreign keys enforce **valid connections**.

## Types of Relationships  

When data lives in more than one table, **relationships** define how that information connects and interacts.  
Think of each table as a separate topic — like “students,” “courses,” or “teachers.” On their own, each table holds useful data, but when linked together, they form a **network of meaning**.  

In a real application:  
- A **user** might have many **orders**.  
- A **teacher** might teach several **classes**.  
- A **product** might appear in many **shopping carts**.  

Relationships help databases mirror these real-world connections. They prevent duplication, keep data consistent, and make it possible to answer complex questions — like:  
> “Which students are enrolled in Mr. Kim’s courses?”  
> “Which customer bought this product last month?”  

Behind the scenes, relationships are made possible through **primary keys** and **foreign keys**.  
- The **primary key** uniquely identifies a record in one table.  
- The **foreign key** is that same identifier stored in another table to create the link.  

Together, they form the “glue” that holds your database together.  

There are three main kinds of relationships that appear in almost every system:  
- **One-to-One (1:1)**  
- **One-to-Many (1:N)**  
- **Many-to-Many (M:N)**  

Relational databases are built around the idea that **data lives in separate tables** — and those tables have **relationships** with each other.

A “relationship” simply describes how rows in one table connect to rows in another table.

There are **three** relationship types:

1. **One-to-One (1:1)**  
2. **One-to-Many (1:N)**  
3. **Many-to-Many (M:N)**  

Each one maps to real-world situations, and understanding them is essential for designing clean, logical databases.

### 1️⃣ One-to-One (1:1)

Each record in Table A is linked to **exactly one** record in Table B — and vice versa.

This is the *least common* relationship type.

Think of it like this:  
➡️ “Every person has exactly one passport.”  
➡️ “Every user has exactly one profile.”

One item, one match.

### Real Example: Users and Profiles

**users**
| id | name |
|----|------|
| 1 | Alice |
| 2 | Bob |

**profiles**
| id | user_id | bio |
|----|----------|------|
| 1 | 1 | Loves SQL |
| 2 | 2 | Enjoys React |

```
+---------+        +-----------+
|  users  | 1   1  | profiles  |
+---------+ <----> +-----------+
| id (PK) |        | user_id (FK, UNIQUE)
+---------+        +-----------+
```

### 💡 Why Use 1:1?
- To separate optional info (bio, avatar, settings)  
- To isolate sensitive info  
- To keep the main 'users' table lightweight  

### How to Create It in SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  bio TEXT,
  user_id INT UNIQUE REFERENCES users(id)
);

```

`UNIQUE` ensures each user has only **one** profile.

---

### 2️⃣ One-to-Many (1:N)

One record in a parent table connects to **many records** in a child table, but each child belongs to **only one** parent.

This is the **most common** database relationship.

➡️ “One teacher teaches many classes.”  
➡️ “One customer makes many orders.”  
➡️ “One blog post has many comments.”

### Real Example: Teachers and Courses

**teachers**
| id | name |
|----|------|
| 1 | Mr. Kim |
| 2 | Ms. Li |

**courses**
| id | title | teacher_id |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | SQL Basics | 1 |
| 2 | Web Dev | 2 |
| 3 | Data Viz | 1 |

```
+-------------+        +---------------+
|  teachers   | 1    N |    courses    |
+-------------+ <----+ +---------------+
| id (PK)     |        | teacher_id (FK)
+-------------+        +---------------+
```

### 💡 Why Use 1:N?
- Prevents data duplication  
- Mirrors real-world hierarchies  
- Makes queries easier and data consistent  

### How to Create It in SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE teachers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  department VARCHAR(100),
  hire_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(100),
  teacher_id INT REFERENCES teachers(id)
);
```

---

### 3️⃣ Many-to-Many (M:N)

Records in Table A relate to **many** records in Table B, and vice versa.

Requires a **join table** (also called a junction or linking table).

➡️ “Students enroll in many courses; courses have many students.”  
➡️ “Products appear in many orders; orders contain many products.”  
➡️ “Users follow many users; users have many followers.”

### Real Example: Students and Courses

**students**
| id | name |
|----|------|
| 1 | Alice |
| 2 | Bob |

**courses**
| id | title |
|----|--------|
| 1 | SQL Basics |
| 2 | Web Dev |

**enrollments**
| id | student_id | course_id |
|----|-------------|------------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 2 | 1 |

```
+-----------+       +---------------+       +------------+
| students  | 1   N | enrollments   | N   1 |  courses   |
+-----------+ <---->+---------------+<---->+------------+
| id (PK)   |       | student_id FK |       | id (PK)    |
+-----------+       | course_id  FK |       +------------+
```

### 💡 Why Use M:N?
- Models complex real-world systems  
- Avoids duplicated info  
- Supports flexible linking between data groups  

### How to Create It in SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  credits INT DEFAULT 3
);

CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INT REFERENCES students(id),
  course_id INT REFERENCES courses(id)
);
```

## Referential Integrity 

Referential integrity is a fancy term for a simple idea:

> **Your data should ALWAYS make sense across ALL tables, no matter what happens.**

It protects your database from invalid, missing, or broken relationships.

### Why Referential Integrity Exists

Imagine a school system:

- A **students** table  
- A **courses** table  
- An **enrollments** table  

Now imagine deleting “Alice” from `students`…

But `enrollments` still contains:

```
student_id = 1  ← refers to Alice (but she’s gone!)
```

Now your system is broken:

❌ “There’s an enrollment for a student who doesn’t exist.”

Referential integrity **prevents this from happening** using foreign key rules.

### What Referential Integrity Guarantees

Foreign keys guarantee:

#### ✔️ 1. You cannot reference a parent row that doesn’t exist
You can’t create an enrollment with `student_id = 99` if student 99 isn’t in `students`.

#### ✔️ 2. You cannot delete a parent if children depend on it (unless allowed)
You can’t delete a course that still has enrollments.

#### ✔️ 3. You cannot update a primary key in a way that breaks relationships
You can’t change a student’s ID if enrollments still reference it.

Referential integrity = **data that never lies.**

---

### Foreign Key Delete Behaviors

When defining a foreign key, you choose what happens when the *parent* row is deleted.

#### 1️⃣ ON DELETE CASCADE

> “If the parent goes away, delete the children too.”

Use when child data cannot exist alone.

Common examples:
- Delete a **student** → delete their **enrollments**
- Delete a **post** → delete its **comments**

SQL:
```sql
ALTER TABLE enrollments
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_student
FOREIGN KEY (student_id)
REFERENCES students(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

#### 2️⃣ ON DELETE RESTRICT

> “You CANNOT delete this parent while children exist.”

Use when children depend on the parent existing.

Examples:
- Cannot delete a **course** if students are enrolled  
- Cannot delete a **product** that appears in orders  

This protects critical data.

#### 3️⃣ ON DELETE SET NULL

> “If the parent disappears, keep the child but remove the connection.”

Use when the child record still has meaning alone.

Examples:
- Teacher leaves → their courses stay, but `teacher_id` becomes `NULL`  

#### ON DELETE CASCADE  
Delete student → delete enrollments

#### ON DELETE RESTRICT  
Cannot delete student until enrollments are removed

#### ON DELETE SET NULL  
Delete student → enrollment.student_id becomes NULL

#### What SQL Does Behind the Scenes

When you delete a row, PostgreSQL checks:

> “Is this row referenced anywhere?”

If yes, PostgreSQL applies your rule:

- CASCADE  
- RESTRICT  
- SET NULL  

If no rule is defined → **RESTRICT** is the default.

This is how SQL prevents silent corruption.

### Why Referential Integrity Matters

Without referential integrity:

- Your app might show “ghost” data  
- Queries return incorrect results  
- Deletes break your UI  
- Analytics become inaccurate  
- Backend logic fails  
- Security holes appear  
- Maintaining the database becomes nearly impossible  

Referential integrity keeps everything predictable and clean.

## SQL Joins and Relationships 

JOINs are the way SQL lets you *read across* the relationships you built using:

- Primary keys  
- Foreign keys  
- Relationship types (1:1, 1:N, M:N)

If your database schema defines clear relationships, JOINs give you the ability to answer real, meaningful questions.

### Why JOINs Depend on Relationships

Imagine your tables as separate boxes:

```
students       enrollments        courses
```

Each one stores information, but none can answer questions like:

- “Which courses is Alice taking?”
- “How many students are in SQL Basics?”
- “Which teacher teaches Data Viz?”

To answer these, tables **must connect**.

They connect through **primary keys and foreign keys**.

### Example (keys that connect)
```
students.id  ←──  enrollments.student_id
courses.id   ←──  enrollments.course_id
```

JOINs use these connections to combine information.

### Step 1 — Relationship Diagram

```
students(id PK)
      ↑
      │
enrollments(student_id FK, course_id FK)
      │
      ↓
courses(id PK)
```

### Step 2 — JOINs Use These Keys

```sql
JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id
JOIN courses     ON enrollments.course_id = courses.id
```

### Step 3 — Result Set (Conceptually)

```
students      enrollments        courses
   ●────────────●───────────────●
```

JOINs follow the **relationship paths** defined in your schema.

---

### How Each Relationship Type Determines the JOIN

### 1️⃣ One-to-One (1:1)

A record in one table has **exactly one** matching record in another.

```
users (1) ←──→ profiles (1)
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT u.name, p.bio
FROM users u
INNER JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id;
```

Use INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN depending on whether you want to include users without profiles.

### 2️⃣ One-to-Many (1:N)

One “parent” record links to **many** children.

```
teachers (1) ───▶ courses (many)
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT t.name, c.title
FROM teachers t
LEFT JOIN courses c ON t.id = c.teacher_id;
```

Use LEFT JOIN when you want to include parents even if they have zero children (teachers with no courses).

### 3️⃣ Many-to-Many (M:N)

Both sides can relate to multiple records. Requires a **link/junction table**.

```
students      enrollments      courses
    1 ─────▶     *     ◀───── 1
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT s.name, c.title
FROM students s
JOIN enrollments e ON s.id = e.student_id
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.id;
```

Only returns students *actually* enrolled in courses.

## Understanding SQL Joins

### 🟦 INNER JOIN — “Only Matching Rows”

An **INNER JOIN** returns **only the rows where a match exists in both tables**.  
If a row has no match on the other side, it is *excluded*.

Think of two lists:
- Students  
- Course enrollments  

If you ask: “Show me only students who are enrolled in something,”  
you would hide students with **no enrollments** — that is INNER JOIN.

```
students (left)          enrollments (right)
    ● Alice  ────────────● enrolled
    ● Bob    ────────────● enrolled
    ● Maria     X (removed: no match)
```

### Example Tables

students:
| id | name |
|----|------|
| 1 | Alice |
| 2 | Bob |
| 3 | Maria |

enrollments:
| id | student_id | course_id |
|----|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 | 10 |
| 2 | 1 | 11 |
| 3 | 2 | 11 |

### SQL Example
```sql
SELECT s.name, e.course_id
FROM students s
INNER JOIN enrollments e 
  ON s.id = e.student_id;
```

### Result
| name | course_id |
|------|-----------|
| Alice | 10 |
| Alice | 11 |
| Bob | 11 |

### 🎯 Use Cases
- Users who made purchases  
- Employees with submitted timesheets  
- Products that appear in orders  
- Students who are enrolled in something  


### 🟩 LEFT JOIN — “Everything on the Left”

A **LEFT JOIN** returns:
- ALL rows from the left table  
- Matching rows from the right  
- `NULL` when no match exists  

If you ask: “Show me **all students**, and enrollment info *if it exists*,”  
then even students with no enrollments must appear.

```
students (left)          enrollments (right)
    ● Alice  ────────────● enrolled
    ● Bob    ────────────● enrolled
    ● Maria  ──────────── NULL (kept anyway)
```

### SQL Example
```sql
SELECT s.name, c.title
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e 
  ON s.id = e.student_id
LEFT JOIN courses c 
  ON c.id = e.course_id;
```

### Result
| name | title |
|-------|--------|
| Alice | SQL Basics |
| Alice | Data Viz |
| Bob | Web Dev |
| Maria | NULL |

### 🎯 Use Cases
- Show all employees (even if they haven't logged hours)  
- Show all users (even with zero posts)  
- Show all products (even if never purchased)  
- Show all teachers (even without assigned classes)  

### 🟧 RIGHT JOIN — “Everything on the Right”

A **RIGHT JOIN** returns:

✔️ **All rows from the right-hand table**  
➕  
✔️ **Matching rows from the left-hand table**  

If no match exists on the left side, the left columns become `NULL`.

A RIGHT JOIN ensures that every course appears, even if it has zero students.

```text
 RIGHT JOIN (students → courses)

students table        courses table
+----------+          +----------------+
| id | name|          | id |   title   |
+----------+          +----------------+
|  1 | Alice|          | 1 | SQL Basics |
|  2 | Bob  |          | 2 | Web Dev    |
                       | 3 | UX Design |
-- no student for UX Design

Result of RIGHT JOIN:

 name   |   title
--------+--------------
 Alice  | SQL Basics
 Bob    | Web Dev
 NULL   | UX Design   <-- appears even with no student
```

### SQL Example

```sql
SELECT s.name, c.title
FROM students s
RIGHT JOIN courses c
  ON s.id = c.student_id;
```

If a course has no matching student, `s.name` will be `NULL`.

RIGHT JOIN is less common in day-to-day development (because you can usually flip the tables and use LEFT JOIN), but it’s still useful when:

- You need to display **all rows from the right table**
- The right table is your **primary list**
- You’re doing **data quality checks**, like:
  - “Which courses have *no* students?”
  - “Which products were *never* ordered?”

### 🟪 FULL OUTER JOIN — “Everything from Both Tables”

A **FULL OUTER JOIN** returns:

✔️ Matching rows  
✔️ Left-only rows  
✔️ Right-only rows  

Nothing is excluded — unmatched data appears with `NULL` on the missing side.

It’s the most “complete” join because it combines the behavior of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.

```text
 FULL OUTER JOIN

students table         courses table
+-----------+          +----------------+
| id | name |          | id |   title   |
+-----------+          +----------------+
| 1 | Alice |          | 1 | SQL Basics |
| 2 | Bob   |          | 2 | Web Dev    |
| 3 | Carol |          | 3 | UX Design  |
-- Carol has no course; UX Design has no student

Result:

 name   |   title
--------+--------------
 Alice  | SQL Basics
 Bob    | Web Dev
 Carol  | NULL          <-- student-only row
 NULL   | UX Design     <-- course-only row
```

### SQL Example

```sql
SELECT s.name,
       c.title
FROM students s
FULL OUTER JOIN courses c
  ON s.id = c.student_id;
```

This result includes:

- Students with matching courses  
- Students without any course (`title` will be `NULL`)  
- Courses without any student (`name` will be `NULL`)  

---

FULL OUTER JOIN is especially helpful for:

#### ✅ Data Comparison & Reconciliation

- Compare two tables that should contain similar entities (e.g., `users` vs `newsletter_subscribers`).
- Find rows missing on either side.

#### ✅ Audits & Debugging

- Identify records that don’t line up between systems.
- Check for orphaned or duplicate data.

#### ✅ Migrations

- When moving from one system to another, verify which rows exist in:
  - only the old system  
  - only the new system  
  - or both  

### Join Summary

| Join Type             | What It Returns                      | When to Use It                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **INNER JOIN**        | Matching rows only                    | When both sides MUST match              |
| **LEFT JOIN**         | All left + matches on right          | Show everything on the left             |
| **RIGHT JOIN**        | All right + matches on left          | Show everything on the right            |
| **FULL OUTER JOIN**   | All rows from both tables            | Compare, audit, reconcile data          |

---

### How Relationships + JOINs Work Together

| Relationship Type | Real-World Example | Typical JOIN | Why |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|-----|
| **1:1** | User ↔ Profile | INNER or LEFT | Combine closely linked tables |
| **1:N** | Teacher ↔ Courses | LEFT JOIN | Show parent rows even without children |
| **M:N** | Students ↔ Courses | INNER JOIN w/ link table | Return real, existing combinations |

JOINs **follow the foreign keys** you defined when modeling your data.

## ALTER TABLE — How Databases Evolve Over Time

When you first create a table, it almost never stays perfect forever.  
Real applications grow, change, and evolve — and your database needs to evolve with them.

**ALTER TABLE** is how you *change* a table after it already exists.

Think of as it as "renovating a building while people are still inside."

The structure stays in place, but you add rooms, rename things, fix issues, or enforce new rules — all without losing data.

You may think:

> “Why not just delete the table and recreate it?”

In real apps, that’s impossible because:

- Your tables may contain **thousands or millions of rows**  
- Data must be kept **forever**  
- Deleting tables risks **permanent data loss**  
- Production systems **cannot go offline**  

This is why `ALTER TABLE` exists — it lets you **upgrade your schema safely**.

ALTER TABLE can:

| Action | Example | Meaning |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Add a column | `ADD COLUMN` | Add new information |
| Remove a column | `DROP COLUMN` | Remove outdated info |
| Rename a column | `RENAME COLUMN` | Fix naming mistakes |
| Change data type | `ALTER COLUMN TYPE` | Convert text → number |
| Add constraints | `ADD CONSTRAINT` | Enforce data rules |

## PostgreSQL Data Types

Understanding column data types is one of the most important parts of designing a database.  

When you create a table, every column must be assigned a **data type**. The data type determines:
- What kind of data is allowed (numbers, text, dates, JSON, etc.)
- How much storage it takes
- How Postgres validates incoming data
- Which operations you can perform (e.g., math, comparisons, indexing)

When you **ALTER** a table, you can:
- Add a new column with a chosen type
- Change an existing column’s type
- Add constraints that affect how the type behaves

Choosing the correct data type keeps your database reliable, fast, and predictable.

---

### 1️⃣ Text Types (STRING DATA)

Use text types to store words, sentences, names, emails, notes, etc.

#### **VARCHAR(n)**
- Stores text with a maximum length you set.
- PostgreSQL prevents storing values longer than `n`.
- Great when you want to enforce limits (like usernames or short labels).

Example:
```sql
name VARCHAR(50)
```

### **TEXT**
- Stores **unlimited-length** text.
- Flexible and common in real applications.
- Good for comments, descriptions, bios.

Example:
```sql
bio TEXT
```

### When to use which?
- Use **VARCHAR** when you need strict limits.
- Use **TEXT** for flexible input.

### 2️⃣ Numeric Types (NUMBERS)

Use numeric types for counts, prices, IDs, and any data involving math.

#### **INT / INTEGER**
- Whole numbers
- Most commonly used numeric type

Example:
```sql
age INT
```

#### **SERIAL**
- Auto-incrementing integer
- Perfect for **primary keys**

Example:
```sql
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
```

#### **NUMERIC(p, s) / DECIMAL**
- Exact decimal precision
- Used for money, calculations, or anything requiring accuracy.

Example:
```sql
price NUMERIC(10,2)   -- means 10 digits total, 2 after decimal
```

### 3️⃣ Boolean Type (TRUE / FALSE)

Represents yes/no, active/inactive, enabled/disabled.

#### **BOOLEAN**
- Values: `TRUE`, `FALSE`

Example:
```sql
is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
```

### 4️⃣ Date and Time Types

Track events, timestamps, and scheduling.

#### **DATE**
Stores calendar dates.

```sql
birth_date DATE
```

#### **TIME**
Stores only time of day.

```sql
class_time TIME
```

#### **TIMESTAMP**
Stores date + time (no timezone).

```sql
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
```

#### **TIMESTAMPTZ**
Stores date + time **with timezone**, recommended for most apps.

```sql
last_login TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
```

### 5️⃣ JSON & JSONB (Structured Data)

PostgreSQL supports JSON storage — great for flexible, evolving data.

### **JSON**
Stores raw JSON text.

#### **JSONB**
Stores JSON in a binary, indexable format.

### Example:
```sql
profile JSONB
```

### Updating JSONB:
```sql
UPDATE users
SET profile = jsonb_set(profile, '{twitter}', '"@alice123"')
WHERE id = 1;
```

Use JSON when:
- Different rows may have different fields.
- You need semi-structured data.

### 6️⃣ Arrays

PostgreSQL allows storing arrays directly inside columns.

Example:
```sql
tags TEXT[]
```

Insert example:
```sql
INSERT INTO posts (tags) VALUES ('{tech,sql,backend}');
```

Use cases:
- Items with multiple labels
- Storing checkboxes or preference lists
- When relationships are too small for a join table

### 7️⃣ Special Types 

#### **UUID**
Universally unique identifiers — safer than serial IDs for public apps.

```sql
id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
```

#### **BYTEA**
Stores binary files (images, PDFs) — usually avoided for large content.

#### **ENUM**
Fixed set of allowed values.

```sql
status ENUM('active','inactive','pending')
```

##  Understanding Indexes in SQL 

Indexes make your queries **faster**, your joins **more efficient**, and your relationships **scalable**.  
This file includes the updated content explaining:

- What indexes are  
- How they work  
- Why they matter  
- When to use them  
- Examples  
- Visuals  
- AND the new section explaining **why primary keys are auto‑indexed but foreign keys are not**  

### What Is an Index?

Think of an index like the index in a book.

Without an index:  
👉 You flip page by page until you find what you need.

With an index:  
👉 You jump straight to the exact page instantly.

Databases behave the same way.

Indexes help speed up:

- `SELECT` queries  
- `JOIN` operations  
- Lookups by foreign keys  
- Sorting operations (`ORDER BY`)  
- Searching on large tables  

### Why Indexes Matter

Without an index, PostgreSQL must scan **every row** (a sequential scan).

With an index, PostgreSQL can:

- Jump directly to matching rows  
- Find related records instantly  
- Enforce relationships efficiently  

This becomes essential as your tables grow from hundreds → thousands → millions of rows.

### 🟦 Primary Keys Are Automatically Indexed

Whenever you create a **PRIMARY KEY**, PostgreSQL automatically creates a **unique index** for it.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

This automatically creates:

- a **unique index** on `id`
- fast lookups  
- fast updates/deletes  
- guaranteed uniqueness  

### Why it matters

Primary keys are used constantly:

- joining tables  
- enforcing relationships  
- deleting or updating records  
- identifying a single row  

Indexes make all of this efficient.

### 🟥 Foreign Keys Are *NOT* Indexed Automatically

> PostgreSQL enforces the foreign key relationship,  
> **but does NOT create an index** on that column.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id INT REFERENCES students(id)
);
```

`student_id` is **not indexed**, which means:

```sql
SELECT * FROM enrollments WHERE student_id = 5;
```

…is slow on large tables.

### Why you should index foreign keys manually

Foreign keys are used for:

- joins  
- cascading deletes  
- filtering  
- integrity checks  

👉 Without an index, these operations are slow.

Add one like this:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_enrollments_student_id
ON enrollments(student_id);
```

### Without Index  
```
[Enrollments table: 500,000 rows]

Find all rows where student_id = 7
↓
Scan row 1
Scan row 2
Scan row 3
...
Scan all rows (slow)
```

### With Index  
```
[Index]
student_id = 7 → points directly to matching rows

Result: Instant
```

## Searching, Filtering, and Grouping in SQL

Now that you're familiar with basic `SELECT` statements and how to retrieve data from a table, it’s time to take the next step: learning how to target the *right data*. 

In real-world applications, databases often have thousands or even millions of rows. You rarely want *all* of it—you want to **slice, dice**, and analyze specific pieces. That’s where searching, filtering, and grouping come in.

These skills are foundational to working with relational databases and are essential for:

- **Building backend APIs** that only return relevant results (like "orders from this customer" or "products under $50").
- **Creating dashboards and analytics reports** that summarize trends (like "top-selling items" or "total revenue last month").
- **Improving performance** by minimizing the amount of data transferred or processed at any given time.

### 1. Advanced `WHERE` Patterns

The `WHERE` clause is how you tell the database **which rows you care about**. Beyond simple `=` filters, you can use patterns like:

### 1.1 Comparisons

```sql
-- Orders over $100
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amount > 100;

-- Orders between $50 and $200
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amount BETWEEN 50 AND 200;
```

**Use cases:**

- Filter by price ranges (`>`, `<`, `BETWEEN`)
- Filter by dates (last 30 days, this year, etc.)

```sql
-- Orders placed in 2025
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= '2025-01-01'
  AND created_at <  '2026-01-01';
```

### 1.2 Lists with `IN`

Use `IN` when you want to match **one field against multiple possible values**.

```sql
-- Orders that are either 'pending' or 'processing'
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing');
```

This is cleaner than:

```sql
WHERE status = 'pending' OR status = 'processing';
```

### 1.3 Ranges and NULL checks

```sql
-- Products with a price set (not NULL)
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price IS NOT NULL;

-- Customers without a city
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE city IS NULL;
```

>`NULL` means “unknown / missing value”, **not** zero and **not** empty string. You must use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`, not `=` or `!=`.


### 1.4 Pattern matching with `LIKE`

`LIKE` lets you match patterns in strings:

- `%` = “any number of characters” (including zero)
- `_` = “exactly one character”

```sql
-- Customers whose name starts with 'A'
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

-- Emails ending in '@gmail.com'
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';

-- Names where the second character is 'a' (e.g., 'Dan', 'Max')
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE name LIKE '_a%';
```

---

### 2. Text Searching

Basic searches use `LIKE`, but for many apps that’s enough.

### 2.1 Partial matches

```sql
-- Products with 'phone' anywhere in the name
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%phone%';
```

**Use cases:**

- Simple search bars (“search by name or email”)
- Admin tools (find users by partial email/domain)

```sql
-- Search customers whose name OR email contains 'frank'
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE name  LIKE '%frank%'
   OR email LIKE '%frank%';
```

> For more advanced search (relevance ranking, typo handling, etc.) you’d use a full-text search feature or a search engine (like Elasticsearch), but `LIKE` is the first step.


---

### 3. Case-Insensitive Searching

By default, many databases treat string comparisons as **case-sensitive** (`'Frank'` ≠ `'frank'`).

### 3.1 Lowercasing both sides

A common pattern:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER('frank');
```

Here we:

1. Convert the `name` in the table to lowercase.
2. Convert the search text `'frank'` to lowercase.
3. Compare them.

This works for `LIKE` too:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE LOWER('%frank%');
```

### 3.2 Why this matters

- Users don’t type emails and names in a consistent way.
- You usually **don’t want** “Frank” and “frank” to be different.

---

### 4. Filtering with Multiple Conditions

Real queries almost always have **more than one condition**.

You combine conditions with:

- `AND` → all conditions must be true
- `OR` → at least one condition must be true
- `NOT` → negate a condition  
- Parentheses `()` → control order of evaluation

### 4.1 Combining conditions with AND

```sql
-- Orders over $100 that are already completed
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND total_amount > 100;
```

### 4.2 Combining conditions with OR

```sql
-- Orders that are either 'pending' or 'processing'
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'pending'
   OR status = 'processing';
```

### 4.3 Mixing AND and OR (with parentheses)

```sql
-- High-value orders or ANY completed orders
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE (status = 'completed' AND total_amount > 100)
   OR total_amount > 500;
```

Big picture:  
- Without parentheses, it’s easy to accidentally filter the wrong set of rows.
- Always use parentheses when mixing `AND` and `OR` so your logic is obvious.


---

### 5. Aggregations: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.

Aggregation functions combine **many rows into a single value**:

- `COUNT(*)` – how many rows?
- `SUM(column)` – total of a numeric column
- `AVG(column)` – average value
- `MIN(column)` / `MAX(column)` – smallest / largest value

### 5.1 Simple examples

```sql
-- How many orders are in the system?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders;


-- Total revenue from all orders
SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders;


-- Average order amount
SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS avg_order_amount
FROM orders;
```

### 5.2 Aggregations with filters

```sql
-- Total revenue from completed orders only
SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS completed_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed';


-- Number of orders in 2025
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orders_2025
FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= '2025-01-01'
  AND created_at <  '2026-01-01';
```

**Big picture:**  
You use aggregations when you care about **metrics** (how many, how much, average per day, total per user, etc.), not individual rows.


---

### 6. `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`

`GROUP BY` is what lets you get aggregations **per group**, not just for the entire table.

- `GROUP BY` → how you split rows into groups
- Aggregate functions → what you calculate per group
- `HAVING` → filter groups *after* aggregation (similar to `WHERE`, but for groups)

### 6.1 Grouping: basic example

**Question:** How many orders does each customer have?

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**What’s happening:**

1. Rows in `orders` are grouped by `customer_id`.
2. For each group (each customer), we count the number of rows.

You can join to `customers` to show names:

```sql
SELECT c.name,
       COUNT(o.id) AS order_count
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name;
```


### 6.2 Grouping with multiple columns

**Question:** How many orders per customer *per status*?

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       status,
       COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id, status;
```


### 6.3 Filtering groups with HAVING

Use `HAVING` when you want to filter **after** aggregations, based on the aggregate values.

```sql
-- Customers with more than 5 completed orders
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(*) AS completed_orders
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

## Key Takeaways

In this section, you learned the core SQL operations used to work with data in relational databases. You practiced how to retrieve information using `SELECT`, as well as how to create, update, and delete records using `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. Together, these commands form the basic CRUD operations that power most modern applications.

You also learned how relational databases organize information into tables and how those tables can be defined and connected using keys and indexes. These relationships allow data to be structured in a way that keeps information consistent and organized across a system.

Understanding how these queries and table definitions work together is the foundation of working with databases in real-world applications.

### What You'll Learn Next

In the next section, we'll shift our focus to **how applications connect
to databases**.

You'll learn how to:

-   Build a **Node.js backend**
-   Design a **REST API**
-   Connect your server to a **PostgreSQL database** and **MongoDB database**
-   Execute **SQL queries from your application code**
-   Send database results back to the frontend

This is where everything starts to come together. Instead of running SQL
manually, you'll build a real backend system that powers a full web
application.
