# Git + GitHub Practice Lab

:tada: Tonight’s Live Git + GitHub Lab Activity!

👉 **Every Friday live session will include a small hands-on lab exercise!**

We’ve been building your first web project (Restaurant Menu or Personal Trading Card). Tonight we’ll take that same project and move it into Git and GitHub so you learn the basic workflow used in real development.

No new HTML or CSS tonight — instead, you’ll learn the Git steps you will repeat for the rest of your career. 😄

## 🎨 What We’re Doing

- create a local Git repository
- track your project files with Git
- make commits with messages
- push your project to GitHub
- make a small update and push again
- learn how to fix small mistakes

👉 Think “my first workflow,” not “memorize all the commands.”

### 1️⃣ Create a Git Repository

Inside your project folder (the one with your Menu or Trading Card), initialize Git. This creates a hidden `.git` folder so Git can track changes in your project.

### 2️⃣ Add Your Existing Files

Tell Git to track your HTML, CSS, and image files.
This step basically says, “Start tracking these files.”

### 3️⃣ Make Your First Commit

Create a commit describing what you have so far.

Examples:
- “Initial version with HTML and CSS”
- “First restaurant menu layout”
- “Initial trading card page”

Any short message is fine.

### 4️⃣ Create a GitHub Repository

Log into GitHub and create a new repo:
- give it a meaningful name
- optional description
- everything else can stay default

This gives your project a home online.

### 5️⃣ Connect Local Git → GitHub

Link your local project to your GitHub repository so pushing becomes possible.

When you push, GitHub will display your files and commit history.

### 6️⃣ Push Your Project

Push your main branch to GitHub so your project now safely exists remotely. Refresh the GitHub page to verify your files appear.

Congrats — you just published your project. 🎉

### 7️⃣ Make One Tiny Change and Commit Again

Make a tiny change:
- edit text
- update a color
- add a sentence

Then:
- add
- commit
- push

Try doing this cycle a couple times.

### 8️⃣ Learn How to Fix Beginner Mistakes

Git mistakes are normal — this section teaches you how to fix the most common ones students run into.

### Accidentally added a file you didn’t mean to?
Just delete it locally, then commit and push again.
The change will sync and the wrong file will disappear.

### Accidentally added a folder you didn’t want?
Same idea:
- remove folder
- commit
- push

### Want Git to ignore certain files next time?
Add a `.gitignore` file and list things like:
- .DS_Store
- node_modules
- backup folders
- build assets (later)

This prevents Git from adding those items in the future.

## ✨ Optional Extra Practice

Try one (or all):
- create a README describing your restaurant or card
- add more commits with descriptive messages
- push changes a few times to feel confident
- edit the README directly on GitHub and then pull locally

## ✅ Lab Requirements

To complete this lab, you should have:

- a local Git repository
- at least 2 commits
- a GitHub repository
- pushed your work to GitHub
- removed one file or folder on purpose and re-pushed
- created a .gitignore (optional, but encouraged)

Same deal as before — build individually during class, and I’ll invite a few folks to share their GitHub project link!
