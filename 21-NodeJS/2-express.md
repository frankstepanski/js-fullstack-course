 # Introduction to Express.js

When you were building servers directly with Node’s `http` module, you probably noticed a few pain points:
- You had to manually check the request method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).  
- You needed to parse JSON by hand.  
- You had to handle routes with a lot of `if` and `else` statements.  
- You repeated code for headers and status responses.  

That’s fine for learning, but it gets messy fast.  
This is exactly why **Express.js** was created — to take all those low-level details and give you a **clean, readable way** to build APIs.

Under the hood, Express still uses Node’s `http` module — it just **wraps it with helpful features**:

- A **routing system** that matches URLs like `/api/users` or `/api/posts`.  
- Built-in tools to **parse JSON** and handle request bodies automatically.  
- A **middleware system** that lets you add features like authentication, logging, or error handling — one small piece at a time.  
- Easy ways to send responses, set status codes, or return JSON.  

So instead of writing 20 lines of logic for a single endpoint, you can do it in 3–4 lines using Express.

- Instead of worrying *how* to send JSON, you just call `res.json()`.  
- Instead of parsing request data manually, Express handles it for you.  
- Instead of chaining `if` statements for routes, you just write `app.get()` or `app.post()`.  

Express doesn’t replace Node — it **runs on top of it**.  
You still use JavaScript, you still rely on the event loop, and you still handle requests and responses — but with **much cleaner syntax**.


## Installing and Using Express

To use Express in your project:

```bash
npm install express
```

Then create a simple server:

```js
// server.js
import express from "express";

const app = express();

// Middleware to parse JSON data automatically
app.use(express.json());

// Routes
app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json([{ id: 1, name: "Alice" }, { id: 2, name: "Bob" }]);
});

app.post("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  const newUser = req.body;
  res.status(201).json({ message: "User created", user: newUser });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => console.log("🚀 Express server running on http://localhost:3000"));
```

That’s it — no need for `createServer`, manual header setting, or body parsing!

##  Converting Your Node Server to Express

Here’s a direct comparison between your previous Node HTTP server and its Express version:

### Before (Plain Node)

```js
import http from "http";

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

  if (req.method === "GET" && req.url === "/api/users") {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(JSON.stringify([{ id: 1, name: "Alice" }, { id: 2, name: "Bob" }]));
  } else if (req.method === "POST" && req.url === "/api/users") {
    let body = "";
    req.on("data", chunk => (body += chunk.toString()));
    req.on("end", () => {
      const newUser = JSON.parse(body);
      res.writeHead(201);
      res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: "User created", user: newUser }));
    });
  } else {
    res.writeHead(404);
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ error: "Route not found" }));
  }
});

server.listen(3000, () => console.log("✅ Node server running on http://localhost:3000"));
```

### After (Using Express)

```js
import express from "express";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json([{ id: 1, name: "Alice" }, { id: 2, name: "Bob" }]);
});

app.post("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  res.status(201).json({ message: "User created", user: req.body });
});

app.use((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).json({ error: "Route not found" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("🚀 Express server running on http://localhost:3000"));
```


| Task | In Plain Node | In Express |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Create server | `http.createServer(...)` | `express()` |
| Check method and URL manually | `if (req.method === "GET" && req.url === "/api/users")` | `app.get("/api/users", ...)` |
| Parse JSON body manually | `req.on("data")`, `JSON.parse()` | `app.use(express.json())` |
| Send JSON response | `res.writeHead(200)` + `res.end(JSON.stringify(...))` | `res.json(...)` |
| Handle 404 errors | Custom logic | Built-in middleware or easily added |

Express simplifies all the repetitive steps so you can focus on **what your API should do**, not the plumbing.

## Routing, Middleware, Static Files, and Error Handling

Now that you’ve set up your first Express server, it’s time to dive deeper into the features that make Express powerful and beginner-friendly.  


### Express Routing 

Routing is how Express decides *which code to run* based on the request’s **URL** and **HTTP method** (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).

### Example:

```js
import express from "express";
const app = express();

app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json([{ id: 1, name: "Alice" }, { id: 2, name: "Bob" }]);
});

app.get("/api/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id; // route parameter
  res.json({ message: `You requested user ${userId}` });
});

app.get("/api/search", (req, res) => {
  const { q } = req.query; // query parameter
  res.json({ message: `You searched for: ${q}` });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("✅ Server running on http://localhost:3000"));
```

#### What’s Happening:
- `app.get("/api/users")` → runs for the exact path `/api/users`  
- `req.params.id` → captures dynamic parts of the URL (like `/api/users/5`)  
- `req.query` → reads query parameters from the URL (like `/api/search?q=react`)  

#### Tip:
Routes are matched **in order**, so always put more specific ones (like `/api/users/:id`) before generic ones.

### Middleware — The Heart of Express

Middleware is one of the most important concepts in Express — it’s what makes it flexible, powerful, and easy to extend.  
Think of middleware as **the behind-the-scenes helpers** that process incoming requests before your routes send a response.

When your frontend app sends a request, that request travels to your Express server.  
Before the server decides **how to respond**, Express can run several **middleware functions**.  

Each middleware can:
- Look at the request data (like headers or JSON)
- Add or change something in the request
- Log it for debugging
- Stop it early (for example, if the user isn’t logged in)
- Or pass it to the next piece of code

You can think of middleware as a **series of checkpoints** between the client and the final response.

```
Client (React fetch) → Middleware 1 → Middleware 2 → Route Handler → Response (to Client)
```

Each middleware runs one after another and decides whether to:
- Modify the request or response  
- Stop the process early (e.g., send an error)  
- Or call `next()` to continue to the next handler  

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // continue to the next middleware or route
});
```

- `app.use()` → applies this function to *every* request.  
- `next()` → tells Express to move on. Without it, the request would hang forever!


### Types of Middleware

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Application-Level** | Runs for all routes in your app | `app.use(express.json())` |
| **Router-Level** | Runs for specific groups of routes | `router.use('/api', checkAuth)` |
| **Built-In Middleware** | Comes with Express | `express.static()`, `express.json()` |
| **Third-Party Middleware** | Installed via npm | `cors`, `morgan`, `helmet` |
| **Custom Middleware** | Written by you | Logging, authentication, validation |

---

### Middleware Stack in Action

Here’s how multiple middleware pieces can work together:

```js
import express from "express";
const app = express();

// 1️⃣ Built-in middleware: parse JSON automatically
app.use(express.json());

// 2️⃣ Custom middleware: log every request
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});

// 3️⃣ Custom middleware: basic authentication check
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const isLoggedIn = true; // just an example
  if (!isLoggedIn) return res.status(403).json({ error: "Not authorized" });
  next();
});

// 4️⃣ Final route handler
app.get("/api/data", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Success! Middleware chain complete." });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("✅ Server running on http://localhost:3000"));
```

#### What Happens When `/api/data` Is Called:
1. Express reads the incoming request.  
2. It runs `express.json()` to parse the body (if there’s one).  
3. It logs the request method and URL.  
4. It checks authentication.  
5. Finally, it reaches your route and sends the response.

That’s the **middleware chain** in action.



### Common Middleware You’ll Use Often

| Middleware | What It Does | Why It’s Useful |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| `express.json()` | Parses incoming JSON data | Needed for POST/PUT requests |
| `cors()` | Enables cross-origin requests | Lets your frontend (on another port) call the API |
| `helmet()` | Adds security headers | Protects your app from common attacks |
| `morgan()` | Logs every request | Great for debugging during development |
| Custom validation | Checks data before saving | Prevents invalid or missing data |

### Visualizing Middleware Flow

```
Frontend Request → express.json() → logRequest → checkAuth → routeHandler → Response Sent
```

Each arrow is a middleware layer — Express processes them **in order**.  
If one fails or doesn’t call `next()`, the chain stops.

### ⚠️ Why Route Order in Express Matters

In Express, **the order of your routes and middleware is critical** because Express processes them **top to bottom**, in the exact sequence they’re written in your file.

When a request comes in, Express checks each route **one by one** until it finds the **first match** — then it stops.  
That means if a *generic* route like `/api/users` appears **before** a *specific* one like `/api/users/:id`, the generic one will always “catch” the request first.

### Example: Route Order in Action

```js
// ❌ WRONG ORDER
app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "All users" });
});

app.get("/api/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: `User ID: ${req.params.id}` });
});
```

If you visit `/api/users/5`,  
Express will **match `/api/users` first**, so it never reaches the `:id` route.

### ✅ Correct Order

```js
app.get("/api/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: `User ID: ${req.params.id}` });
});

app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "All users" });
});
```

Now, `/api/users/5` correctly matches the `:id` route,  
and `/api/users` still works for the full list.

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways

| Concept | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Top-to-Bottom Matching** | Express reads routes in the order you write them. |
| **First Match Wins** | Once a route matches, Express stops checking others. |
| **Specific Before Generic** | Always put routes like `/api/users/:id` before `/api/users`. |
| **Middleware Follows the Same Rule** | `app.use()` middleware runs in order too — top to bottom. |

### Serving Static Files - HTML, CSS and Images

Express can serve static files — things like HTML, CSS, images, or even your **built React app** — directly to users. This is useful both for simple web pages and for deploying full-stack apps.

```js
import express from "express";
const app = express();

app.use(express.static("public")); // serve all files in the public folder

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("🌍 Static file server on http://localhost:3000"));
```

If your folder structure looks like this:

```
my-app/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── script.js
└── server.js
```

Then visiting `http://localhost:3000/index.html` or even just `http://localhost:3000/` will automatically serve that file.

### Why This Is Useful (Even with React)

You might think you never need this if you use React, but static serving is still important in several real-world cases.

#### 1. Serving Your Built React App (Production)

In development, React runs its own server (`npm start`).  
But when you deploy, React becomes a folder of static files — HTML, JS, and CSS — that Express can serve.

Example:

```js
import path from "path";
import express from "express";
const app = express();

app.use(express.static("client/build"));
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "client", "build", "index.html"));
});
```

This allows Express to serve both:
- Your React app (from `/`)
- Your API (from `/api/...`)

✅ Result: a single full-stack Node app that works without CORS issues.

#### 2. Serving Static Assets

Even if your frontend is hosted elsewhere, you might still need Express to serve:
- Images and icons  
- PDFs or other downloadable files  
- Uploaded files from users (e.g., profile pictures)

Example:

```js
app.use("/assets", express.static("uploads"));
```

Now files are accessible at:  
`http://localhost:3000/assets/filename.jpg`

#### 3. Hosting Simple Non-React Pages

Sometimes, you just need a small page — maybe an admin dashboard, documentation, or a “coming soon” screen.  
Instead of using React for that, you can drop an HTML file in `/public` and Express will handle it.

#### 4. Combining Frontend + API for a Full-Stack App

If your frontend and backend are in one project, serving the static frontend through Express:
- Keeps everything under one domain (no cross-origin problems)  
- Makes deployment simpler (just one app to run)


| Use Case | Why It’s Useful |
|-----------|----------------|
| Serve built React app | Combines API + frontend into one deployment |
| Serve images/files | Provide static resources like uploads or icons |
| Serve small HTML pages | Simple landing pages or admin tools |
| Avoid CORS issues | One domain for both client and server |

#### TL;DR

- **In development:** React runs its own dev server — Express is only your API.  
- **In production:** Express serves your React build and API together.  
- **Other cases:** You can still use it for images, PDFs, or simple static pages.

So even if you’re using React, Express’s static file serving is a handy tool for deployment and flexibility.
