# Product Management 

Product Management sits at the intersection of **technology, business, and user experience**.  
A **Product Manager (PM)** ensures that what gets built not only works correctly but also meets user needs and delivers real value — on time and within scope.

## 1. Software Quality (The Three Perspectives)
High-quality software doesn’t happen by accident — it comes from **clear roles**, **good communication**, and **shared responsibility** across the team.

Quality is not just about “does it work?” — it's about "does it work *for the people who need it* and *does it work reliably*?"

### Three-Part Handshake Model

| Perspective | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Validated by Clients** | Ensures the product meets *user expectations*. | “This solves the problem we care about.” |
| **Verified by Developers** | Confirms the product *works correctly*. | Tests pass, data loads correctly, no errors. |
| **Managed by the Product Manager** | Balances quality, scope, deadlines. | “We launch basic search now; advanced search later.” |

### Big Picture
- Clients care about usefulness  
- Developers care about correctness  
- PMs care about direction and timing  

Together, they ensure the product is useful, functional, stable, and delivered on time.

## 2. What Is Software Product Management (SPM)?

**Software Product Management (SPM)** is the practice of **planning, defining, and managing software products** throughout their lifecycle.

PMs focus on:

- Understanding *what users actually need*  
- Deciding *what features matter most*  
- Organizing the team’s work  
- Ensuring the product delivers value  
- Communicating between business, design, and engineering  

---

### 💡 Why It Matters

Without product management, teams risk:

- Building features nobody wants  
- Overspending time on low‑value work  
- Losing sight of the business goal  
- Designing confusing experiences  

A strong PM keeps everyone moving in the **same direction**.


### 🎧 Real-Life Example: Spotify

- Engineers write the backend and UI.  
- Designers create flows and visuals.  
- **Product Managers connect everything** — defining *what*, *why*, and *when*.

     └────────────────────────┘
```

## 4. How SPM Connects to the SDLC
SPM decides **what** to build and **why**, while SDLC determines **how** it gets built.

SPM and the SDLC are two sides of the same coin.

| Product Management (SPM) | SDLC |
|---------------------------|------|
| Defines the **problems** | Designs and builds **solutions** |
| Understands users | Engineers implement features |
| Prioritizes features | Developers plan sprints and workload |
| Sets expectations | Tests, deploys, maintains |

PM = **strategic vision**  
SDLC = **technical execution**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PRODUCT MANAGEMENT                      │
│  Vision • User Needs • Priorities        │
└───────────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                    │ feeds into
                    ▼
     ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
     │   SDLC (Plan → Build → Test → Deploy)│
     └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 5. How PM Influences Each SDLC Phase

### 5.1 Requirements Phase — PM Leads
PM gathers:

- User needs  
- Acceptance criteria  
- Business constraints  
- Success metrics  

This becomes the **source of truth** for engineering.

### 5.2 Design Phase — PM + Design + Engineering Collaborate

PM ensures designs:

- Match user expectations  
- Align with goals  
- Fit within time/scope  

Designers create prototypes; engineering reviews feasibility.

### 5.3 Development Phase — Engineering Leads, PM Supports

PM answers:

- “What should this do?”  
- “What is the priority?”  
- “What’s needed for this feature to be complete?”  

Developers build according to SDLC steps.

### 5.4 Testing Phase — PM & Engineering Validate

Engineering tests:

- Functionality  
- Edge cases  
- Performance  

PM tests:

- “Does this solve the user’s problem?”  
- “Does it match the stories and acceptance criteria?”  

### 5.5 Deployment Phase — PM Coordinates Release

PM works with:

- Engineering  
- DevOps  
- QA  
- Sometimes marketing  

### 5.6 Maintenance Phase — PM Takes Over Again

After release, PM:

- Reviews real user feedback  
- Examines metrics  
- Prioritizes next improvements  
- Starts the cycle again  

## 6. Product Managers in Agile & Scrum  
### *How PMs guide teams, shape product direction, and keep delivery on track*
 
Think of the PM as the person who keeps the team focused on solving the *right problems* at the *right time* — while making sure the work aligns with user needs and business goals.

In Scrum, the PM often overlaps with the **Product Owner** role, but the core responsibilities remain the same: **define value, prioritize work, guide the team, and validate outcomes.**

>The **Scrum Product Owner (PO)**  
Focuses on the day‑to‑day execution inside the development team.
Owns the product backlog.
Writes/refines stories, clarifies details, and accepts sprint work.
Ensures the team builds the right thing each sprint.

Scrum is an *iterative* framework. Instead of building everything at once, teams work in short cycles called **sprints**, each producing a usable piece of the product.

#### **A PM ensures that:**

- The team works on the **highest-value features**
- Requirements are clear and achievable
- Work matches both **user needs** and **business strategy**
- Each sprint delivers something meaningful

### The PM’s Core Responsibilities in Scrum

#### 1. **Own and Manage the Product Backlog**
The backlog is the *master list* of all ideas, tasks, and features.

#### PM responsibilities:

- Write user stories  
- Prioritize items (highest value first)  
- Break large ideas into achievable tasks  
- Clarify acceptance criteria  
- Continuously refine backlog items  

**Big Picture:**  
The PM ensures the team is always working on the *right thing* — not just what is loudest or most urgent.

#### 2. **Define the Product Vision & Roadmap**
The PM communicates:

- Why the product exists  
- Who it’s for  
- What problems it solves  
- What the future looks like  

**Analogy:**  
The PM is the *navigator* — engineering is the *driver*.

#### 3. **Guide Sprint Planning**
During Sprint Planning, the PM:

- Presents high-priority backlog items  
- Explains context, requirements, constraints  
- Answers questions from engineering  
- Ensures the team understands *what success looks like*  
- Helps define a realistic sprint goal  

**The PM does NOT:** assign tasks or decide technical implementation.

#### 4. **Collaborate Daily With the Team**
PMs often join or review standup notes.

Day-to-day duties:

- Provide clarification  
- Unblock decisions  
- Coordinate with stakeholders  
- Confirm priorities  

They ensure the team stays aligned and moving forward.

#### 5. **Review Sprint Work & Accept Features**
During the **Sprint Review**, the PM:

- Looks at completed work  
- Confirms whether acceptance criteria are met  
- Provides user-focused feedback  
- Accepts or requests adjustments  

#### 6. **Lead the Problem-Solving in Retrospectives**
PMs contribute by identifying:

- Requirement clarity issues  
- Communication gaps  
- Planning/scope problems  
- Workflow inefficiencies  

#### 7. **Connect Stakeholders and the Team**
PMs communicate regularly with:

- Clients  
- Executives  
- Designers  
- QA  
- Marketing  
- Engineering leads  

They translate business needs into actionable technical work.

### 🗓️ A PM’s Day-to-Day Activities

#### **Morning**
- Review standup updates  
- Respond to questions  
- Check sprint progress  

#### **Midday**
- Meet with designers and engineers  
- Clarify stories  
- Review prototypes  
- Groom the backlog  

#### **Afternoon**
- Analyze usage data  
- Update roadmap  
- Prepare demo/review notes  
- Sync with QA  

>**In simple terms:**  
> The PM ensures the *right work* gets done, at the *right time*, for the *right reasons*.  

## 7. JIRA (Product Management Tool)

**Jira** is one of the most widely used tools in the software industry for tracking work, organizing tasks, and keeping teams aligned.  
Think of Jira as a digital command center where developers, designers, and product managers all see what’s happening, what’s coming next, and what’s done.

### Projects  
A **Project** is a collection of all work related to a specific product, feature set, or team.

- Each course, app, or company team often gets its own Jira project.
- It contains all issues, sprints, settings, and reports for that initiative.

**Example:**
- *Student Portal App*
- *E‑Commerce Website*
- *CTD Practicum Backend API*

A project keeps everything organized in one place.

###  Issues (Tickets)
An **Issue** is a single piece of work.

Think of it like a digital sticky note that describes what needs to be done.

Issues can represent:
- A **feature** (e.g., “Build login page”)
- A **bug** (“Fix mobile navigation glitch”)
- A **task** (“Write documentation for API endpoint”)
- An **improvement** (“Optimize homepage loading speed”)

Every issue has:
- A title  
- A description  
- Assignee (who’s doing the work)  
- Status (To Do → In Progress → Done)  
- Priority  
- Comments  
- Attachments  

### Epics
An **Epic** is a large goal that takes many steps to complete.  
Epics group multiple issues under one umbrella.

**Epic Example:**
- **User Authentication System**
  - Issue: "Design login UI"
  - Issue: "Build login API"
  - Issue: "Create password reset feature"
  - Issue: "Add user registration"

Epics give teams a high‑level picture of progress.

### Stories (User Stories)
A **User Story** describes a feature from the *user’s perspective*, not the developer’s.

Format:
```
As a <type of user>,
I want <some goal>
so that <some outcome>.
```

**Example:**
```
As a user,
I want to reset my password
so I can access my account if I forget it.
```

User stories help teams focus on user needs instead of just technical tasks.

### Tasks & Subtasks
- A **Task** is a small piece of work needed to complete a story or epic.
- A **Subtask** breaks a task into even smaller steps.

Tasks are highly actionable:
- “Write validation logic”
- “Create Figma mockup”
- “Add unit tests”

These help developers estimate and track progress accurately.

### Sprints
A **Sprint** is a short development cycle — usually 1–3 weeks.

During a sprint:
- The team selects issues from the backlog  
- Everyone works on them  
- At the end, they review what was accomplished and plan the next sprint  

**Think of a sprint as a mini‑deadline.**

### Boards
Boards provide a **visual workflow** showing where each task stands.

A common board workflow:
```
To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done
```

Teams drag issues from left to right as work progresses.

Boards help answer:
- What is being worked on?
- Who is doing what?
- What’s ready for review?
- What’s completed?

### Backlogs
The **Backlog** is a prioritized list of all future work.

It contains:
- Ideas
- Planned features
- Bugs
- Future improvements
- Anything not being worked on *right now*

During **Sprint Planning**, teams pull tasks from the backlog into the new sprint.

##  Wrapping It All Up

You've just explored some of the *most important* ideas in modern software development — Product Management, quality, SDLC, Agile/Scrum, Jira, and how teams work together.

If these concepts feel big right now, that’s okay — they’re supposed to. Every professional developer learns them gradually, and you're already ahead of the curve.

No matter how good a developer you become, software engineering is *never* a solo sport.
Real products happen because multiple roles collaborate effectively.

You're not just learning to code — you’re learning how real engineers work together.

Stay patient. Stay consistent. You’ve got this. 🚀✨
