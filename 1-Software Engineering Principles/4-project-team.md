#  Understanding Teams, Requirements, and Resources

Building software is much more than just writing code.  
It’s a **team effort** that blends technology, design, communication, and planning — all guided by the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.  

##  1. The Team Behind Software Development

Every successful project relies on a variety of team members — each with a unique role and focus.  
Think of it like building a house: architects, builders, designers, and inspectors all work together to create something safe and useful.

Here are the key roles you’ll find in a typical SDLC team:

| Role | Main Responsibilities | Focus |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| **Project Manager (PM)** | Oversees the timeline, budget, and progress. Makes sure the project stays on track. | *“Are we meeting deadlines and goals?”* |
| **Product Manager** | Defines *what* should be built and *why*. Connects business needs with user expectations. | *“What problem are we solving?”* |
| **Software Engineer / Developer** | Writes and maintains the code that makes the software work. | *“How do we build it?”* |
| **UX/UI Designer** | Designs how users interact with the product. Creates wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. | *“Is this easy and enjoyable to use?”* |
| **QA (Quality Assurance) Engineer** | Tests the software to find bugs and make sure it meets requirements. | *“Does this work as expected?”* |
| **Software Architect** | Designs the overall structure of the system — how all parts fit together. | *“Is this system stable and scalable?”* |
| **Stakeholders** | Anyone with an interest in the project — clients, customers, or management. | *“Does this meet our goals?”* |

> Each role adds a different perspective — technical, business, design, or user experience — all working together toward one goal: **a reliable, user-friendly product**.

##  2. Business Requirements vs. User Requirements

Before any coding begins, teams need to understand *what the software should do* — and *why*.

There are **two main types of requirements** that guide this process:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Business Requirements** | High-level goals that describe what the organization wants to achieve. | “Increase customer engagement by 30% using a mobile app.” |
| **User Requirements** | Specific needs and expectations of the end users. | “As a user, I can track my orders in real time.” |

**Business requirements** focus on *strategy and outcomes*, while  
**user requirements** focus on *experience and usability*.

Both are essential:  
- Business requirements make sure the software supports company goals.  
- User requirements make sure the software actually helps the people using it.

>  Together, they form the “why” and “who” behind the project — the foundation of any SDLC.

##  3. The Role of the UX Designer

Before writing a single line of code, it’s critical to understand **how users will experience the product**.  
That’s where the **UX (User Experience) Designer** comes in.

A UX designer’s job is to make sure the software is **useful, usable, and delightful**.  
They combine research, psychology, and design to create smooth user journeys.

### What UX Designers Do

| Task | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **User Research** | Interview or observe real users to understand their goals, frustrations, and behavior. |
| **Personas** | Create fictional “user types” that represent different kinds of users (e.g., “Busy Student Sam”). |
| **Wireframes** | Simple sketches of pages or screens that show layout and flow (before adding color or visuals). |
| **Storyboards** | Visual stories showing how a user interacts with the app step-by-step. |
| **Prototypes** | Clickable mockups that simulate how the app will feel before it’s coded. |

### Why UX Work Comes *Before* Coding

- It’s **cheaper and faster** to adjust designs than to rewrite code later.  
- It helps developers know *exactly* what to build.  
- It reduces misunderstandings and wasted effort.  
- It ensures that real users can actually use and enjoy the final product.

>  **In short:** Good UX design prevents bad software.  
> You wouldn’t build a house without blueprints — and you shouldn’t build software without UX planning.

## 4. How Product & Project Managers Analyze and Prioritize Requirements

Once requirements are gathered, **not everything can be done at once**.  
That’s where **Product Managers** and **Project Managers** help the team decide what to focus on first.

### Product Manager’s Focus
- Evaluates **business value**: Which features bring the most impact?  
- Uses frameworks like **MoSCoW**:
  - **M**ust have  
  - **S**hould have  
  - **C**ould have  
  - **W**on’t have (for now)  
- Balances user needs with company goals.

> Example: “We’ll build task creation first because users can’t use the app without it.”

### Project Manager’s Focus
- Turns priorities into **a schedule** and **tasks**.  
- Manages **resources**, **deadlines**, and **communication**.  
- Tracks risks and progress through tools like Trello, Jira, or Asana.

> Example: “We’ll spend Week 1 on planning, Weeks 2–4 on development, and Week 5 on testing.”

Together, they make sure the **right features get built** — at the **right time** — with the **right resources**.

##  5. Project Resources: The Building Blocks of a Successful Project

Every software project depends on a combination of **resources** — the inputs needed to complete the work.  

| Resource Type | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Time** | How long the project or each phase takes. | Sprint timelines, deadlines |
| **Budget** | How much money is available. | Developer salaries, tool subscriptions, hosting |
| **Human Resources** | The people working on the project. | Developers, designers, QA, PMs |
| **Technical Resources** | The tools and infrastructure. | Laptops, servers, APIs, frameworks |

Balancing these resources is key.  
If one changes (for example, less time or fewer developers), others must adjust too — maybe by cutting features or simplifying design.

> ⚖️ This balance is called the **Project Management Triangle**:  
> **Time ⏳ + Cost 💰 + Scope 🎯 = Quality ✅**

If one side changes, the others must adapt to maintain quality.

##  6. Resource Planning Practices

**Resource planning** ensures that the team can deliver the project efficiently without burnout or waste.

Here’s how managers plan resources during the SDLC:

### 1. **Define the Scope**
List what will (and won’t) be built in this project phase.  
> Example: “The first release includes login, dashboard, and reports — not notifications.”

### 2. **Estimate Effort**
Developers and designers estimate how long each task will take (often in *story points* or hours).  
> Example: “Login feature – 2 days; Dashboard – 5 days.”

### 3. **Assign Roles**
Decide who does what based on skills and availability.  
> Example: “Jamie handles backend; Riley focuses on frontend.”

### 4. **Schedule Work**
Use sprints, milestones, or deadlines to structure the timeline.  
> Example: “Sprint 1: Planning; Sprint 2: Core features; Sprint 3: Testing.”

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
Check progress regularly. If deadlines slip, adjust priorities or resources.  
> Example: “We’ll delay new features to focus on bug fixes.”

> 💡 **Good resource planning** means the right people, with the right tools, working on the right things — at the right time.

##  Summary

| Concept | Key Takeaway |
|----------|---------------|
| **Team Roles** | Each role (PM, Product Manager, Engineer, UX, QA) contributes different expertise. |
| **Requirements** | Business = company goals; User = end-user needs. Both must align. |
| **UX Design** | Essential early step — defines how users will interact with the product before coding starts. |
| **Prioritization** | PMs balance time, value, and goals to decide what to build first. |
| **Resources** | Time, budget, people, and tools — all must be managed carefully. |
| **Resource Planning** | Define scope, assign roles, schedule, and monitor progress for success. |

> 💬 **In short:**  
> Successful software projects don’t start with code — they start with **people, planning, and purpose**.  
> Understanding how teams, requirements, design, and resources fit into the SDLC is the first step to thinking like a software engineer.
