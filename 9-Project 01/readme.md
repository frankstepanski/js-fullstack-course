# Project 01: Basic Business or Personal Website

### Project Overview

You are tasked with **creating an informational website** for either:
- A **freelance professional** (like a photographer, artist, or developer), or  
- A **business**, real or imaginary (like a restaurant, coffee shop, or local store).

Examples:
- A portfolio site for a photographer friend  
- A landing page for a fictional pizza restaurant  

You have full creative control over your topic and design! 
However, you’ll be evaluated on both your **technical implementation** and **workflow process** — not just how it looks.

## Key Skills Covered
- **HTML** — structure your content  
- **CSS** — style your website  
- **Git & GitHub** — manage your workflow and version control  

## Workflow Requirements

These requirements relate to **how** you plan and build your project — not just the code.

### Planning Phase (Before Coding)

#### 1️⃣ User Stories
Write at least **three user stories** that describe how users will interact with your site.

**Example:**
> As a visitor, I want to see examples of the photographer’s work so I can decide whether to hire them.

#### 2️⃣ Wireframes
Create wireframes for **each page** of your site.  
They should include key elements like:
- Images  
- Links  
- Buttons  
- Navigation  

Wireframes can be drawn **on paper** or created using a free tool like [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

### Development Phase

Before writing any code:

1. **Create a GitHub repository** on [GitHub.com](https://github.com)  
2. **Clone it** to your local machine  
3. **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages such as:  
   - `"add navigation bar to home page"`  
   - `"add form validation to contact page"`

## Technical Requirements

Your website must meet the following coding standards:

| # | Requirement | Description |
|---|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Page Structure** | At least 3 separate `.html` pages **or** 3 separate sections within a single-page layout that are linked via navigation. |
| 2 | **CSS File** | A `style.css` file in a `/css` folder containing your custom styles. |
| 3 | **Linked Stylesheet** | All `.html` pages must link to your shared `style.css`. |
| 4 | **Navigation Bar** | Use `<a>` tags to link between all pages or sections. |
| 5 | **Images** | Include at least one image (`<img>` tag). |
| 6 | **Form** | Include a form with at least **three fields** — two must be required. |

**Optional Bonus:**  
Use [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io) to receive form submissions.

### 💡 Additional Technical Challenges

| # | Requirement | Description |
|---|--------------|-------------|
| 8 | **Multi-Column Layout** | At least one page should use a grid layout (e.g., Bootstrap’s grid system). |
| 9 | **Bootstrap Component (Optional)** | Include a carousel or tabs component for extra credit. |
| 10 | **GitHub Repository** | Your full project must be pushed to GitHub. |
| 11 | **HTML Validation** | Validate your HTML at [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/) — no errors allowed (warnings are okay). |

## Deliverables

To successfully complete your project, include the following in your submission:

1. 🧠 **User Stories** (3 minimum)  
2. 🧾 **Wireframes** — one for each major view or page  
3. 💻 **Source Code** — hosted on your GitHub repository  
4. 📘 **README.md File** (in the root folder) that includes:
   - Your **name**
   - **Project overview/description**
   - **How to use your site** (features, pages, etc.)
   - **Technologies used** (HTML, CSS, optional Bootstrap)
   - **Ideas for future improvement** (minimum of 3 ideas)
5. 🧩 **GitHub Commit History**
   - Minimum **15 commits**
   - Clear, descriptive commit messages
6. 🌐 **Hosted Website**
   - Use **GitHub Pages** for deployment

> ✅ Everything must be public and accessible — include both your GitHub repo link and hosted site link in your submission document.

## Submission Instructions

Submit the following in **one Word document**:
- 🔗 Your **GitHub repository link**  
- 🌍 Your **live hosting link (GitHub Pages)**  

Upload this document under the **Project Submission** section in your course portal.

## Project Grading Criteria

I will evaluate your project based on:

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Functionality** | Does it work as intended? |
| **Robustness** | Is the site stable and bug-free? |
| **Creativity & UX** | Is it visually appealing and user-friendly? |
| **GitHub Structure** | Are commits consistent and descriptive? |
| **Documentation** | Does the README explain your project clearly? |

## Tools and Resources

- [GitHub Pages Guide](https://pages.github.com/)
- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

## Final Notes

- You can choose **any topic** for your site, as long as it includes all required elements.  
- You **don’t need to match the example wireframes exactly** — creativity is encouraged!  
- Your project should demonstrate:
  - A complete workflow from planning → coding → deployment  
  - Clean HTML/CSS  
  - A well-documented GitHub repository
