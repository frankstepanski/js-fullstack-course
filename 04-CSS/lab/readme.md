 # Fridays Live CSS Lab Activity! 🎉 

👉 **Every Friday live session will include a small hands-on lab exercise!**

Last week we built solid HTML…  
This week we’re giving it a **style glow-up!** 💅✨  

You’ll take the SAME project (Menu or Trading Card) and transform it using CSS. I’ll again ask a few random folks to share what they’ve styled — just like last time!

## 🎨 What We’re Doing

- colors  
- fonts  
- spacing  
- borders  
- sections that look like cards  
- a tiny bit of flexbox  

👉 Think “before ➜ after” makeovers!

### 1️⃣ Create a styles.css

Add a link to your styles.css file inside your HTML head section.

### 2️⃣ Background

Pick a color (anything except plain white 😄)

### 3️⃣ Fonts + Headings

Choose a readable font-family and give your headings their own color.

### 4️⃣ Main Container

Add padding, margin, border, and border-radius. Think “card” or “menu box” around your main content.

### 5️⃣ Section Spacing

Add margin and padding between content blocks for better visual spacing.

### 6️⃣ Tiny Flexbox

Choose ONE:
- Center your whole page  
- Or put 2 sections side-by-side

### 7️⃣ Link Styles

Change your link color and add a hover effect to make links interactive.

## ✨ Optional Extra Flair

- drop shadow  
- subtle background pattern  
- rounded cards  

## ✅ Lab Requirements

- linked CSS file  
- colors + fonts  
- box model spacing  
- at least one flexbox layout  
- styled link with hover

Same deal as before — build individually during class, and I’ll invite a few folks to show off their CSS glow-ups!
