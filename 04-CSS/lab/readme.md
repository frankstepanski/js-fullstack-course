 # Fridays Live CSS Lab Activity! 🎉 

👉 **Every Friday live session will include a small hands-on lab exercise!**

- Restaurant Menu  
- Personal Trading Card  

The goal of this lab is to get comfortable with the **basic Git workflow** you’ll use constantly as a developer.

## What We’re Doing Tonight

You will:

- Create a local Git repository  
- Track your existing project files  
- Make commits with messages  
- Push your project to GitHub  
- Make a small change and push again  

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Initialize Git

Turn your project folder into a Git repository.

This tells Git:  
“Start tracking changes in this folder.”

---

### 2. Add Your Files

Tell Git to start tracking your project files, including:
- HTML  
- CSS  
- images  

At this point, Git knows what files exist, but nothing is saved yet.

---

### 3. Make Your First Commit

Create your first commit with a clear message.

Example commit messages:
- Initial version with HTML and CSS  
- First restaurant menu layout  
- Initial trading card page  

Any clear and descriptive message is fine.

---

### 4. Create a GitHub Repository

Log into GitHub and create a **new repository** for your project.

This is where your code will live online.

---

### 5. Connect Local → GitHub

Link your local Git repository to your GitHub repository.

This connection allows you to push your code from your computer to GitHub.

---

### 6. Push Your Project

Push your commits to GitHub.

After pushing:
- refresh the GitHub page  
- confirm your files appear  
- confirm your commit history is visible  

🎉 Congrats — your project now lives on GitHub!

---

### 7. Make One Tiny Change

Edit something small in your project:
- change some text  
- tweak a color  
- add a sentence  

Then repeat the workflow:
- add  
- commit  
- push  

Try this cycle a couple times to build confidence.

---

## Fixing Common Beginner Mistakes

- Added a file you didn’t want?  
  Delete it → commit → push  

- Added a whole folder by accident?  
  Remove it → commit → push  

- Want Git to ignore files going forward?  
  Create a `.gitignore` file and add things like:

  .DS_Store  
  node_modules  


## Optional Extra Practice

Try one (or more):

- Add a `README.md` describing your project  
- Make a few more commits with clear messages  
- Edit the README directly on GitHub, then pull the changes locally  


## Lab Checklist

By the end of this lab, you should have:

- A local Git repository  
- At least 2 commits  
- A GitHub repository  
- Your project pushed to GitHub  
- One file or folder removed and re-pushed  
- A `.gitignore` file (optional but encouraged)  

---

Same as always: build individually during class, and I’ll invite a few people to share their **GitHub repo link** at the end!
