 # Fridays Live Bootstrap Lab Activity! 🎉 

👉 **Every Friday live session will include a small hands-on lab exercise!**

Last time we built solid HTML and then gave it a style glow-up using CSS.  
Tonight we take the SAME project even further by adding **Bootstrap** to enhance layout, spacing, and visual polish. We’ll continue building on the exact same Menu or Trading Card project you’ve already been working on.

I’ll again ask a few random folks to share what they’ve styled — just like before!

## 🎨 What We’re Doing

- linking Bootstrap into your existing project  
- upgrading layout with containers and rows  
- improving spacing and visual structure  
- trying out cards and buttons  
- practicing responsive design basics  

👉 Think **CSS glow-up ➜ Bootstrap power-up!**

### 1️⃣ Add Bootstrap

Include Bootstrap’s CDN link in your head (place it above your own CSS file).

### 2️⃣ Bootstrap Container

Wrap your main content in a Bootstrap container to give it proper spacing and alignment.

### 3️⃣ Typography Classes

Try Bootstrap typography utilities:
- text-center
- fw-bold
- text-muted

### 4️⃣ Cards and Sections

Convert at least one part of your page into a Bootstrap card to create visual sections.

### 5️⃣ Spacing Utilities

Use Bootstrap spacing classes for margins and padding:
- mt-3
- mb-4
- p-3

### 6️⃣ Simple Grid

Try putting two sections side-by-side using:
- row
- col

It should stack vertically on small screens and sit side-by-side on wider screens.

### 7️⃣ Buttons

Add one Bootstrap button anywhere:
- primary
- secondary
- outline

## ✨ Optional Extra Flair

- use display headings (display-5, display-6)  
- try Bootstrap’s text colors (text-primary, text-success)  
- add a subtle card shadow  
- responsive images

## ✅ Lab Requirements

- Bootstrap linked (using CDN)  
- at least one Bootstrap container  
- spacing utilities  
- at least one card  
- one simple grid layout  
- one Bootstrap button

Same deal as before — build individually during class, and I’ll invite a few folks to share their Bootstrap upgrades!
