# JavaScript Lab: Working with Classes

🎯 Tonight’s Live Lab: JavaScript Classes

👉 **Every Friday live session includes a small hands-on lab exercise!**

This week we’re focusing on **JavaScript Classes** — a core part of object-oriented programming that helps you build reusable blueprints for real-world things.

## 📘 What You’ll Practice

You’ll create an app using **at least two JavaScript classes**, where **one class will be used inside the other**.

You’ll learn:
- How to define a `class` using the `class` keyword
- How to use `constructor()` and `this`
- How to create multiple instances of a class
- How to connect class objects together
- How to run a JavaScript app in Node.js (no web browser needed!)

## 💡 Choose One of These App Ideas

Each of these apps will run from a `.js` file and **print to the console** using `console.log()`.

You do NOT need to build a web page — this is pure JavaScript run in the terminal.

### 🧙 Option 1: Fantasy Pet Simulator

- Create a `Pet` class (name, species, health)
- Create a `Trainer` class that owns multiple pets
- Allow the trainer to train pets, heal them, or list their info
- Add methods to simulate training sessions

✅ Requirements:
- 2 classes (Trainer, Pet)
- Use an array to store multiple Pet instances inside the Trainer
- Add at least 2 methods to each class

### 📦 Option 2: Package Delivery System

- Create a `Package` class (tracking number, destination, status)
- Create a `DeliveryTruck` class that holds and delivers packages
- Simulate loading, delivering, and listing package statuses

✅ Requirements:
- 2 classes (Package, DeliveryTruck)
- One class should **contain instances** of the other (truck has packages)
- Include methods to deliver packages, update status, etc.

## 🧪 What You’ll Turn In

- A single `.js` file
- Class definitions for both classes
- Methods that print info using `console.log()`
- At least one class uses another class inside it
- Run it with: `node yourfile.js`

## 🧠 Stretch Ideas

- Add input using `prompt-sync` to allow users to interact with your app
- Add random behavior or loops to simulate more turns
- Add error handling or limits (like max packages or pet health)

Build it individually during class — I’ll invite a few students to share what they built!
